"""Render PERF.md from the battery's raw TSV.

    perf-tables-render.py table.tsv PERF.md meta.txt [census.tsv]

Pure formatting: every number comes from the TSV.  Re-runnable without
re-measuring, and the TRACKED record is what a re-render must read:

    scripts/perf-tables-render.py perf-data/table.tsv PERF.md \
        perf-data/meta.txt perf-data/census.tsv

LAYOUT RULE (user, 2026-09-05): *three columns, instructions only, one
run per cell, no superseded noise.*  The file shows the current matrix —
official, trusted (`--trusted`), verified (`--verified`) — with the exit code
and accepted-declaration count beside every cell, and nothing else.  No
historical columns, no retired flags, no "was X" annotations; prose stays
at a few lines.

Added without breaking that rule: the input census (a property
of each stream, not of any checker), and — for the `mathlib-full` row
only — wall minutes and peak RSS, printed as data in their own small
table.  The worker-count table comes from `parallel.tsv` beside the
census, and is wall time too: labelled as indicative, never as a
measurement.
