"""Generate a synthetic export stream of N trivial declarations.

    scripts/gen_linear_stream.py N OUT.ndjson

Each declaration is `def cI : Sort 1 := Sort 0` — that is, `Type := Prop`
— which type-checks against the empty environment: no basis block, no
prior constant, no binder, no literal.  The per-declaration checking work
is therefore CONSTANT, and the only thing that grows across the stream is
the environment and its name index.

**What it is for** (task #182).  Instructions on this stream must be
LINEAR in N.  A super-linear row means some structure that grows with the
environment is being *copied* rather than updated in place — the classic
Lean reference-counting failure, where a `Std.HashMap` is still reachable
from a second reference at the moment of `insert`, so `lean_array_uset`
takes `lean_copy_expand_array_nonlinear` and rewrites the whole bucket
array.  At 3 000 000 declarations that copy is unmissable; at the size of
`init-full` it hides inside the noise, which is exactly how task #179's
census passed over it.

Usage in a check (instructions per declaration must stay flat):

    for n in 100000 300000 1000000; do
      scripts/gen_linear_stream.py $n /tmp/syn-$n.ndjson
      perf stat -e instructions:u con-leche --verified /tmp/syn-$n.ndjson
    done

Measured on master 339e026d: 89 851 / 88 941 / 88 823 instructions per
declaration at N = 100 000 / 300 000 / 1 000 000.
