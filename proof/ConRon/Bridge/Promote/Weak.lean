# `ConRon.Bridge.Promote.Weak` — the readback at the promote window's invariant

`Arena/WF.lean`'s `StoreWF'` (DESIGN `### Task #97-P5-Fresh`) is `StoreWF` minus
the freshness clauses at every tier, and minus `consS`'s `←` half.  None of the
three missing clauses is about the RANK, and the rank is all the readback needs: a
node's children rank below it, so the fuel `denote*` is run at is invisible.

So this module is `Arena/WFProofs.lean`'s "the fuel disappears" layer, re-run from the
weak invariant — the argument verbatim, one word changed per lemma.  It is what the
promotion's walks (`Bridge/Promote/Walk.lean`) unfold `denote*` with.

Every name here is primed and lives in `ConRon.Bridge`: the strong lemmas are
`ConRon.Arena.*`, and `Refine2/Checker/Shape.lean` has its own
`ConRon.Arena.EWFAt'.rank_lt`, so a `ConRon.Arena`-namespaced copy here would
clash in any environment importing both tiers (the capstone's).
