/- NOT a `module` (task #231): `main` here drives `ConLeche/PinGen/*`, which
is `meta` code (a `public meta section` there).  A `module` root cannot call
it from a non-`meta` definition, and making the root `meta` instead produced
an executable that segfaults on start — so this generator root stays
classic, which may import `module`s and may call their `meta` code. -/

# `natop-pins-export` — the pin dump generator (task #176)

Writes the pinned `Nat`-operation declarations and their certificate
proof blobs to `<outdir>/<toolchain>.json`, and — since task #191 —
the **built-in prelude** the pins' order-sensitive ground needs to
`<outdir>/<toolchain>.prelude.ndjson` beside it (a lean4export-format
stream the checker's frontend embeds and prepends to every input; see
`ConLeche/PinGen/Prelude.lean`).  Prints both paths.  The default
`<outdir>` is the repository's top-level `pins/`, where the dump is
COMMITTED (see `pins/README.md`); `tests/pindump.sh` regenerates into
a scratch directory and `diff -q`s both files, so a stale dump fails
the battery.

    lake exe natop-pins-export                 # regenerate in place
    lake exe natop-pins-export _tmp/scratch    # for the freshness gate

**Which toolchain's dump it writes is the project it is run in**
(task #275).  The same sources are built by the repository AND by one
`pinners/<toolchain>/` Lake project per committed pin variant; the
generator labels and names its output after the `lean-toolchain` it
finds by searching upward from the working directory
(`ConLeche.PinGen.readToolchainString`, cross-checked against
`Lean.versionString`), which is why regenerating a foreign variant is

    cd pinners/<toolchain> && lake exe natop-pins-export ../../pins

and nothing else.  See `pinners/README.md`.

`import ConLeche.PinGen.Certs` above is the *build-order edge* the old
mechanism lacked: the certificate theorems are read out of their olean
at run time (`importModules` at `OLeanLevel.private`, so the proof
bodies are visible), and this import is what makes Lake build that
olean first.  Nothing in the checker's own build depends on it any
more.
