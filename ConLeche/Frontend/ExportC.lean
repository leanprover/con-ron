# Direct-to-`ExprC` export parsing (task #171)

The user order: the cached pipeline parses the ndjson export
**directly into `ExprC`** — no parse arena, no `ofStore` conversion,
no interned detour.  The export's `ie`-indices *are* the sharing: the
format already externalizes exactly the DAG structure the arena
reconstructs, so the parse keeps a stream-index-keyed table of
`ExprC` values and a table hit is a shared node by reference.
Sharing is preserved structurally; the derived fields are computed
once per node by the smart constructors, which is also what makes
every parsed term well-formed **by construction** — the entry obligation
the capstone consumes (`ConLeche/Verify/Cached/ParseC.lean`), replacing
`OfStoreC`'s index-memo lemma.

**The stream is read as bytes** (task #256): the driver asks the
handle for 4 MiB at a time, carries the incomplete tail into the next
chunk, and hands every complete line to the byte recogniser of
`ConLeche/Frontend/Scan/Fast.lean`, which decodes it into a syntax
record (`LineRec`) still in stream indices.  `applyLine` below is the
semantic half: it resolves the indices against the tables, builds the
nodes through the smart constructors, and runs the taint policy, the
prelude dedupe, the projection rewrite and the in-process modeller.
There is one grammar in the tree and no `Lean.Json` on the checking
path.

The pin-matching consumers (basis and quotient blocks) read the parsed
slot itself; the tree-size budget that used to bound them was retired
at task #215 (`ConLeche/Frontend/Export.lean`).

**Three pure transformations of the parsed list happen here, below
the verified fold** — the fold sees their result as an ordinary list
of records, and the main theorem quantifies over that list:

* **the built-in prelude (task #191, `ConLeche/Frontend/Prelude.lean`)**:
  every parse is handed the checker's own prelude (the six pinned
  basis blocks and `Bool`), prepends its records, and drops a later
  stream copy of one of them when it is the same declaration
  (declining the run when it differs) — `pushDecl` below;
* **the ground hoist (task #191, `ConLeche/Frontend/NatOpGround.lean`)**:
  a pinned `Nat` operation's stream-certified structural ground is
  moved ahead of it when the stream declares it later;
* **the projection-function rewrite (2026-09-06,
  `ConLeche/Frontend/ProjRec.lean`)**, the one surface rewrite this
  parse performs on a definition record: a projection function
`fun p⃗ self => .proj T i self` of a structure-like owner the direct
install does not serve is replaced, before it reaches the checker, by
the recursor application the module documents.  Three bookkeeping
tables feed it — the owners of every parsed inductive block
(`projOwners`), the field sorts read off the `T._model.proj_i.iota`
artifacts the in-process modeller GENERATES (`projLevels`; task #219:
the generated records are the only source, and the scan runs on them
alone), and whether the `PUnit` basis block has been seen (the
constant motives need it).

/-! ## The built-in prelude (task #191)

The checker's own little prelude — the pinned basis blocks and the
`Bool` block, the order-sensitive ground of the pin-certified `Nat`
operations (`ConLeche/PinGen/Prelude.lean`) — is a parsed stream of its
own (`ConLeche/Frontend/Prelude.lean`) that every parse PREPENDS to its
result, so the fold installs it first, unconditionally.  A later
stream record under a prelude name is compared with the prelude's
copy up to the basis-matching canonical form (`ConstantInfo.canon`:
binder names, binder infos and level-parameter names erased): the
same declaration is DROPPED (it is already installed), a different
one DECLINES the stream (exit 2, naming the declaration — the user's
word; note the contrast with the pinned basis blocks, whose
mismatching redefinitions keep REJECTING through the reserved-name
check, as before).  Basis blocks are matched by kind: the stream's
`Nat` record parses to `basisDecl .natK` exactly as before and is
dropped as the prelude's duplicate. -/

comparison (`opaqueDecl` is told apart from `defnDecl` by `sameCanon`'s

/-- Streaming direct parse off an open handle.

The handle is read strictly forward, 4 MiB at a time, and is never
seeked, re-opened or asked for its size — so the source may be a
*pipe* just as well as a file (task #180: no scratch file at all,
anywhere; `Main.lean`).  It is a property to preserve: a seek or a
re-open here would silently re-introduce a temp file.

The unconsumed tail of a chunk — at most one incomplete line — is
carried into the next one, and `st` is threaded as a plain argument so
that the parse tables stay uniquely referenced across steps (task #78:
a handler that closes over the state holds it at RC 2 and every insert
inside copies it). -/
