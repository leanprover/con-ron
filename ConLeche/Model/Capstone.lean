# The P capstone's shape (task #161, P4 — frozen early, per the ruling)

Two deliverables, both statement-sensitive and frozen here before the
harvest layer builds toward them:

* **the business end, proved now**: `no_constant_of_Empty` — an
  environment carrying the P invariant stores no constant of type
  `Empty`.  The membership is `mem_type` (the `denoteMeta` reading, bit
  numerals), the reading of `.const emptyName []` is the leaf by the
  `denoteMeta` constant clause, and the leaf's `interp` value is the
  empty set by erasure injectivity at the constant constructor +
  `EnvS.empty_pinned` — the same three-move argument as
  `no_constant_of_Empty_2`, one currency over.
* **the final statement, frozen** (checked against the goal's letter —
  consistency of the checker on sort-annotated syntax, hypothesis
  minimal, the #16 precedent):

  `no_proof_of_Empty_pure : ∀ (V) [SetTheory V] {μ}, μ.verifiedChecks = true →
   ∀ {F ds env'}, checkDeclsPure μ (fueledOps μ F) pins ds = .ok env' →
   ∀ c ∈ env'.consts, c.toConstantVal.type = .const emptyName [] →
   False`

  Input-level hypotheses ONLY: the accepted run, the stored constant,
  its type — plus the validating mode, which is part of the goal's
  letter (the annotated checker IS the verified mode; `--trusted`
  ignores annotations by design).  No residue hypotheses: the
  intermediate, install-tier-conditional form is a *milestone shape*,
  never the close (the conditional-forms ruling).

**The semantic bill is empty** (task #161, ENDGAME A).  This file used
to carry `SemTierInputsP`, the ∀-environment form of `TierInputsAt`'s
non-env-tier fields.  The four semantic tiers emptied it — literal,
caps, the proj/str install rows, iota — and its last field,
`accepted_reads`, is now `acceptedReads_of`
(`Steps/Accepted.lean`): a syntactic totality walk over `inferBody`'s
clauses, where every `denoteMeta` failure mode is one of the front door's
own acceptance guards.  So the structure is deleted, and the harvest
layer proves: accepted stream ⇒ `Nonempty (EnvModelM …)` at the final
environment, with only the *install-tier* bundles as premises; this
file's `no_constant_of_Empty` then closes the capstone.

/-! ## The Empty pin, at the core carrier -/

/-- The annotated `Empty` leaf is the pinned constant
(`acval_empty_pinned` at the denoteAnnot-free carrier).

**The pin is now a PREMISE** (task #161 S3): the core no longer
contains an `EnvS`, so `EnvS.empty_pinned` is not available from it.
The premise is stated in exactly the shape the census's §1.5 P-native
carrier field takes (`∀ ψ, ∃ u, cvalE emptyName ψ = emptyT u`), so S7
discharges it by projection when the field lands; until then the fold
layer supplies it from its v1 residue. -/

    (hpin : ∀ ψ : Name → Nat, ∃ u, m.cvalE n ψ = emptyT u)

    ∃ u, m.acval n ψ = .const .empty [u] := by
  obtain ⟨u, hu⟩ := hpin ψ
  exact ⟨u, erase_eq_const (by rw [m.acval_erase, hu]; rfl)⟩

/-- …so its `interp` reading is the empty set, at every
assignment.  Stated at any name whose leaf is an `emptyT` pin (task
#181): `Empty`'s is `emptyT 1`, `False`'s is `emptyT 0`. -/

/-- **The empty-pin argument, at any pinned name** (task #181): an
environment carrying the P invariant stores no constant whose type is
a reserved constant whose direct pin is `emptyT u` — the membership is
`mem_type` at the `denoteMeta` reading, the reading of `.const n []` is
the leaf by the constant clause, and the leaf's `interp` value is the
empty set by erasure injectivity plus `basis_pinnedL`.  The `Empty` and
`False` capstones are its two instances. -/

/-! ## The remaining bill: none

**`SemTierInputsP` is gone.**  The structure named `TierInputsAt`'s
non-env-tier fields in ∀-environment form, and the four semantic tiers
emptied it one by one — literal (`Interp/NatStepP.lean`), caps
(`Steps/CapsRows.lean`, `Interp/CapsP.lean`), the proj/str install
rows (`Steps/StrLit.lean`, `Steps/Reads.lean`,
`Steps/ProjRows.lean`) and iota (`Steps/IotaRows.lean`).  Its last
field, `accepted_reads`, is `acceptedReads_of`
(`Steps/Accepted.lean`), so the bundle has nothing left to carry and
is **deleted** rather than left as an empty structure: an empty
hypothesis is still a hypothesis in every downstream signature, and
the milestone capstone's census is read off those signatures. -/

/-- The env-fixed tier bundle, from the semantic inputs + the fold's
invariant + the one bespoke literal-tier fact (`nat_heads`, an install
product of the `Nat` basis — supplied by the fold at that install and
carried by `EnvModelM`). -/

    TierInputsAt V μ mp.base2 φ :=
  TierInputsAt.ofEnvModelM mp
