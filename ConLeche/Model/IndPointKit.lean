# The point stage's kit (task #161, IND TIER part 5)

The four small facts `pointS` reads that part 3's frame kit and part
4's stage kit left out, because they belong to the *spine* rather than
to the frame or to the fit: a read spine's pointwise lookup, `instSeq`
over an application, injectivity of `mkAppN` at equal arities, and the
determinacy of a `TeleFitPA` residual.

All four are `Term`-level facts one currency over and are transposed
verbatim — they mention no `interp`, no bit, and no environment
except through `TeleFitPA`.  `AnnotTerm.mkAppN_inj` is the one that
carries the point stage's weight: the crossed constructor residual and
the fired index pin are both applications of the *same* arity, and the
stage reads their arguments off pointwise.
