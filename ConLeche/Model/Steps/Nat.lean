# The literal tier, P currency (task #161)

The three routed literal rows — `ReduceNatReads` (`Steps/Reads.lean`),
`ReduceNatStep` (`Steps/Whnf.lean`), `ReduceNatStepPQ`
(`Steps/DefEq.lean`) — all key on the same run: `reduceNatFueled`'s success.

## What lands here

`reduceNat`'s reduct is a **leaf**: a `Nat` literal, or a `Bool`
constructor constant applied to nothing (`ConLeche.reduceNat_inv`).  So
every conjunct of the three rows *except one* is a fact about a leaf,
and this file proves them all, unconditionally:

* the reduct **reads** (`denoteMeta_of_natLeaf`) — the literal under the
  support guard, the constant under its stored-arity guard, both of
  which the accelerating branch's own condition supplies
  (`reduceNat_natLeaf`, the branch analysis);
* the reduct's **frame conditions** (`frame_of_natLeaf`) — a leaf has
  no `fvar` and no loose `bvar`, so `WScoped`/`looseBVarsBounded`/
  `LeavesBounded`/`CtxOk` are free, exactly as in the collapse lane's
  `reduceNat_frameR`;
* the reduct's **grading** (`wellDenotedV_of_natLeaf`) — `natLit_factsAV`
  and `AnnotValid_natLitAV` on the numeral spine, `acval_wellDenoted` and
  `AcvalValid` on the constant.

That closes `ReduceNatReads` outright (`reduceNatReads_of`) — with
one environment law since task #161's item B3: `NatOpGuardLaw`, the
`nat_ops`/`div_mod` fields read in the direction the shrunk
reduction-time test needs (see `NatOpGuardLaw` below).

## The wall that stood here, and how it fell (SUPERSEDED)

The one conjunct the leaf analysis cannot give is the `interp`
equality of `ReduceNatStep`/`ReduceNatStepPQ`.  It was isolated here
as `NatOpSemP` — the campaign's first named wall (task #161 LITERAL
TIER seal II) — with `reduceNatStepP_of_sem`/`PQ_of_sem` machine-
checking that it was *all* that was missing.  All three are now
**deleted**: the law landed, and the two rows are proved outright in
`Interp/NatStepP.lean` (`reduceNatStep_of`/`reduceNatStepPQ_of`),
which consumes this file's leaf analysis unchanged.

The route was the one the wall record named: **not** the erasure
transfer, but `EnvModelM.nat_ops`/`EnvModelM.div_mod` — the stored
operations' recurrences at `interp`, established at their own
installs from the recorded run certificates (`Interp/NatEqsP.lean`,
`Interp/DivModCertP.lean`) — plus the numeral transports
(`Interp/NatSemP.lean`, `Interp/NatWfP.lean`) and the widened
`WhnfInputs.nat`/`TierInputsAt.nat_step` signature, which now carries
the whnf IH the wall record recorded as owed.

## The refuted erasure factoring (PERMANENT RECORD)

The natural plan was to reuse the collapse lane, which proved this row
at `ConLeche/SetR/Bridge/ReduceNat.lean` (`reduceNat_stepR`): read the
subject through `denoteMeta_erase`, run the v1 row, and transport the
answer back along `EnvModel.acval_erase`.  **That route is refuted,
and the refutation is already on record** — `Interp/EnvLaws2.lean`'s
module docstring names `ReduceNatStep2` as one of three residues
"blocked not on proofs but on environment laws that do not exist over
`interp`", because "the erasure link cannot carry it: `interp` is
the two-regime annotation-driven interpretation, **not**
`interp ∘ erase`".

Two independent confirmations, both checked rather than assumed:

1. **The species lemma is false at the generality the row needs.**
   `interp V ρ ea = interp V ρ ea.erase` holds only where the two
   interpretations agree clause for clause, i.e. on `AnnotTerm`s with no
   `.lam`/`.pi` node (`lamR v`/`piR v` vs `lamC`/`piC`) *and* no
   `.const` node where `bval` and `bval` differ (`natSuccV =
   lamR 1 omega natsucc` vs `natSuccV = lamC omega natsucc`;
   `Interp/Value.lean` records `emptyRec` as differing outright).
   The subject of this row is `.app (acval c ψ) …` with `acval c ψ`
   the *stored* leaf of a `Nat` operation — a λ-tower.  So the
   factoring is unavailable exactly where it would be used.  Stated
   for the record: it *is* available on the reduct — a numeral spine
   over the two head leaves — but the reduct side is not what the
   equality needs.

2. **The v1 row does not conclude an equality anyway.**
   `reduceNat_stepR` concludes `Red μ env cval φ Δ v w`, whose
   soundness (`Red.sound`, `Sound/Main.lean`) consumes
   `EnvSHyp.nat_ops` — the `NatOpsV` battery of
   `Sound/NatOps.lean` (892 lines) at the *collapse* `interp`/`cval`.
   The P quarters conclude the `interp` equality directly, so that
   battery had to exist again at `interp`/`acval`.  It now does
   (`Interp/NatSemP.lean` + `Interp/NatWfP.lean`), built on the
   run-certificate laws rather than transported.

/-! ## The reduct's shape, with the guard that makes it read

`ConLeche.reduceNat_inv` already reports the reduct's *shape* — a `Nat`
literal or a bare constant.  A reading needs more: the literal clause
of `denoteMeta` is guarded by `natLitSupported`, and the constant clause
needs the name stored at the right arity.  Both are supplied by the
accelerating branch's own `if` condition, so the strengthening below
is the same branch analysis with the condition retained. -/

/-- **The reduct's shape, guarded.**  What `reduceNat` can hand back,
together with the stored-environment fact that makes it read. -/
def NatLeaf (env : Env) (e : Expr) : Prop :=
  (∃ n, e = .lit (.natVal n) ∧ natLitSupported env = true) ∨
    ∃ (bn : Name) (ci : ConstantInfo), e = .const bn [] ∧
      env.find? bn = some ci ∧ ci.toConstantVal.levelParams = []

/-- Every `natOpResult` under its guard is a guarded leaf: a `Nat`
literal (and `natOpGuard` implies `natLitSupported`) or one of the two
`Bool` constructors (which `natOpGuard` pins, with no level
parameters, for exactly the names that can produce them).  This is
`Bridge/ReduceNat.lean`'s `denote_natOpResultR` with the denotation
stripped off. -/

/-- **The install fold's `Nat`-op invariant, in the form the literal
tier reads it** (task #161 de-gating item B3, harvest site 37 / list
entry P7).  `reduceNat` tests `natOpStored` — one `Env.find?` — where
it used to re-derive `natOpGuard` per literal hit; the guard is what
the leaf analysis below needs (`natLitSupported` for the numeral
shapes, the two `Bool` constructors for the comparison shapes), and it
is carried by `NatOps`/`DivMod`, whose statement is exactly "stored
as a `defnInfo` → guard ∧ the recurrences".  So the tier reads the
guard off the environment, and nothing about the shapes changes. -/
