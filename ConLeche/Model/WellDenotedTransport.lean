# `WellDenotedV`'s substitution metatheory (task #161, P3 batch 2)

`WellDenotedV := WellDenoted ∧ AnnotValid` is the P-tier truthfulness
currency (`Claims.lean`), and every threading clause that crosses a
binder needs it to survive the same two moves the halves survive
separately: lifting (`WellDenoted_liftN` / `AnnotValid_liftN`) and
instantiation (`WellDenoted_inst0` / `AnnotValid_inst0`).

The file exists for a *layering* reason rather than a mathematical
one.  `WellDenotedV` is defined in `Claims.lean`, which imports
`Annot/ValidV.lean`; so the conjunction's transport laws cannot live
beside the halves they are assembled from.  Nothing here is new
content — each lemma is `⟨half₁ …, half₂ …⟩`.

**The premises are paid per half.**  `AnnotValid_inst` takes bit
validity of the substituted term, `WellDenoted_inst` takes hereditary
truthfulness of it, and the conjunction takes exactly their
conjunction — no half is charged for the other's premise.  See
`Annot/ValidV.lean`'s note on why the `bvar` clause forces this.
