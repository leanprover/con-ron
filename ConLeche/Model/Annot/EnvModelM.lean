# `EnvModelM` — the P-tier environment invariant (task #161, P4)

The install tier's target, per the P4 design note in DESIGN.md: the
denoteAnnot-free environment carrier (`EnvModel`) *contained*, plus the
fields the P bundles read.  (Batch 8 slimmed the containment from
`EnvModelUM` to `EnvModel` — the FINDING in `Annot/EnvModel.lean`: the
P fold stores `denoteMeta`-numeraled leaves and so can never supply the
denoteAnnot-currency fields, which the P surface never reads.)  The deltas
against the canonical fields, each a payoff of the fuel-free reading:

* **existence, not uniqueness** — `defn_reads` is `AcvalDefnInst`
  (batch 4): a stored definition's or theorem's value *reads*, to the
  constant's own leaf.  The canonical `acval_defn` retreated to a
  uniqueness form because all-fuel existence is refutable
  (`envS2_defn_lam_refuted` — `denoteAnnot` fails on binders at small
  fuel); `denoteMeta` has no fuel, and a checked value is never out of
  fragment.
* **the stored types read, are graded, and are inhabited** —
  `type_reads`/`type_wellDenotedV`/`mem_type`, at the *uninstantiated* type
  over every ground assignment; `denotePInstLevels` (an equality)
  delivers every instantiated form, so no arity or fuel bookkeeping
  appears anywhere.
* **the leaves are bit-valid** — `acval_validV`, `acval_wellDenoted`'s
  `AnnotValid` companion; establishment at install is the P2 front
  door's own validation, transported by the claims.

The bundle-supplying layer below (`constTypeP_of` the worked example;
its siblings follow the same three-field read) is what the quarter
induction (`checkSoundP_of_inputs`) consumes — the structure exists so
that a `Nonempty (EnvModelM …)` carried through the declaration fold
makes the induction's hypotheses *facts*.

/-- **The structural-`Nat` recurrence law at the validated-annotation
tier** (task #161, the wall's supplier): every stored structural
operation's defining equations read under `denoteMeta` and hold as
`interp` equalities at the two-variable `Nat` context — `NatOpsV`
(`Sound/Motives.lean`) with `denote`/`interp`/`cval` replaced by
`denoteMeta`/`interp`/`acval`, and the level composition normalized to
the plain assignment (the heads are level-monomorphic).

Supplied as an `EnvModelM` field: established at the operation's own
install from the recorded `isDefEqCore` runs (`NatEqsRun`) through
`DefEqClaim` — the run-certificate route (`Interp/NatEqsP.lean`)
— and preserved across every other fresh cons.  Consumed by the
numeral-transport inductions (`Sound/NatOps`' shape at `interp`),
which close `ReduceNatStep`/`PQ` below. -/

(`Sound/Motives.lean`) with `interp`/`cval` replaced by
`interp`/`acval`.  `DivModClausesV` is already valuation-generic, so
it is reused verbatim: only the valuation it is fed changes.

install from the recorded certificate runs (`DivModPinR`'s
`checkDivModCerts` verdict) through `InferClaim`/`DefEqClaim` —
the run-certificate route again (`Interp/DivMod.lean`) — and
preserved across every other fresh cons.  Consumed by the WF-op

/-- **The pinned `Eq` spine's value at `interp`** — `EnvS.eq_lawV`'s
mirror one currency over, stated directly at the three-fold
application (the only form the certificate consumers read; v1 states
the two-fold `lamC` form because its η/unit consumers need the
rigidity clause, which nothing here does).

**This is an environment law, exactly as in v1**: `EqLawV` is an
`EnvS` *field*, not a theorem, because the `Eq` leaf's value is fixed
by the basis install (`Install/BasisS.lean`'s `eqValT` — the `.eqE`
former η-expanded) and by nothing else.  The P mirror is a field for
the same reason, and its supplier is the P basis install
(`BasisStepPB`, routed): the annotated `Eq` tower's *regime bits* are
invisible to every other `EnvModelM` field, and the erasure factoring
that would import the v1 law is refuted at exactly the λ-nodes this
tower is made of (the literal-tier seal II finding 1).  See the task
#161 LITERAL TIER seal III record. -/

`EnvS.reduce_ops` (`ReduceOpsV`, `SetR/EnvS.lean:138`) one currency
over, with `interp`/`cval` replaced by `interp`/`acval`.  The stored
`Lean.reduceNat`/`Lean.reduceBool` leaf, applied to a member of its
element type's reading, *is* that member.

**This is an environment law, exactly as `eq_law` is**: the opaque's
leaf value is fixed by its own install (`checkReducePin`'s identity
certificate) and by nothing else, so the only possible supplier is
that install.  The v1 field cannot be imported — the transfer would
be an erasure factoring of `interp` through `interp`, refuted at
exactly the λ-nodes the operation's leaf is made of (the literal-tier
seal II finding 1, the same refutation that makes `EqLaw` a field).

**Establishment**: `reduceOps_install` (`Interp/ReduceOps.lean`),
at the opaque cons, from `ReducePinR`'s *recorded* identity-certificate
run (`isDefEqCore μ env F 1 (.app valA (reduceCertVar c))
(reduceCertVar c) = .ok true`) through `DefEqClaim` at the
one-entry element context — the run-certificate route's fifth
execution.  **Preservation**: `reduceOps_cons_fresh` at every other
fresh cons (the law mentions two stored leaves, so it crosses).
**Consumer**: the `ofReduceNat`/`ofReduceBool` axiom branch
(`Interp/AxiomReduceP.lean`), whose innermost membership obligation
is exactly `op a = a`. -/

/-! ## The structure-capability laws (task #161, caps tier)

`CapsOkV`'s mirror at the validated-annotation currency: the stored
families' fired η and unit-like laws, value-level, keyed exactly as
the v1 field (`Sound/Motives.lean:309`) on the stored `indInfo`, the
capability flag, the non-reserved name, and the completed family
(`EtaFamilyStored`).

Design decisions, recorded (the lane lead's freeze; the statements
below are unchanged from `Interp/CapsP.lean`'s first landing, which
is now the *preservation* file — the definitions moved here because
the `EnvModelM` field must import them and `CapsP` imports `EnvModelM`):

* **The telescope fit is `TeleFit`, not `TeleFit2`.**  `TeleFit2`
  (`Annot/Spine2.lean`) demands every product in the graph regime
  (`v ≠ 0`), which a `Prop`-valued family's telescope violates.
  `TeleFit` mirrors `TeleFitV` instead — memberships only, the
  peeled body read under the extended environment (the `interp`
  analogue of `B.inst a`), no positivity anywhere.  Consumers recover
  residual memberships through `app_mem_piR`, whose `v = 0` fibre
  premise is the type reading's `AnnotValid` — the literal tier's
  establishment move, reused (`NatEqsP.lean`'s finding: no bit
  positivity is ever needed).
* **The laws carry their readings** (`∃ TVa, …`), the `NatOps`
  pattern: establishment stores the instantiated type's reading at
  its own environment; preservation transfers it *forward*
  (`denoteMeta_cons_fresh_mono`); consumers identify it with their own
  reading by determinism.  The equality-form crossing is refutable
  at support-completing installs (the `LitStabilityP` lesson), so no
  backward transfer ever appears.
* **The fired content is value-level** (the divmod-leg lesson): `ts`,
  `x`, `y` are bare `V`s, and the fabricated η spine is
  `projSpines`/`etaFabArgsV` — `projSpinesV`/`etaFabArgsV`
  (`Rel.lean:98/106`) with `cval`-leaves replaced by `interp` values
  of the `acval` leaves at the same assignment.

**Establishment**: at the inductive install — `IndStepPB`'s bill (the
routed bundle already owes the whole `EnvModelM` at an `indDecl` cons;
this adds no census entry).  The v1 establishment path is the
capability pipeline (kernel pin → `EtaPins` → rule_fold → `ModeledOk`
law → cert+sound, `Install/EtaLawS.lean`); the P path re-runs its
defeq certificates through the claims — the run-certificate route —
when the ind tier lands.  Consumers: `StructEtaIrrel` /
`StructUnitIrrel` (`Steps/CapsRows.lean`), discharged from the
field by the caps batch. -/

/-- **The annotated telescope fit** (`TeleFitV`'s `interp` mirror):
each argument value inhabits its progressively-peeled domain, the
peeled body read under the extended environment.  No positivity — the
squash-regime products fit too, and consumers recover memberships
through `app_mem_piR` with the validity fibre facts. -/

/-! ## The fired modeled-iota contract (task #161, iota tier)

`RecRuleLawV`/`RecRulesV`'s mirror (`Sound/Motives.lean:145/207`) at
the validated-annotation currency.  This is the campaign's long pole;
the statement-freeze discipline is at its strictest here, and every
deviation from the v1 shape is a recorded decision:

* **The law stays `AnnotTerm`-indexed**, exactly as `RecRuleLawV` is
  `Term`-indexed.  The caps/divmod value-level lesson does NOT
  transfer: the truthfulness transport is inherently about the
  applied reduct's *reading* (the producing `IotaStep` row must hand
  the whnf loop a graded reading), and `WellDenotedV` is `AnnotTerm`-indexed.
  An earlier value-level draft of this block died on exactly that
  conjunct.
* **`TeleFitPA` is `TeleFitV`'s transpose, substitution-peeling** —
  `B.inst a` at the argument's *reading*, one ambient environment,
  exactly v1's shape one currency over.  The consumer-validation pass
  killed the earlier cons-environment draft: its residual diverged
  syntactically from the substituted readings the certificate's
  `defEqList` runs compare, re-opening the seal-22 gap the fit was
  meant to close.  Substitution-peeling is available here because the
  arguments are readings (the caps tier's `TeleFit` had bare values
  and could not substitute — hence its `teleFit_of_inst` detour,
  which this fit never needs): `denoteMeta_beta` gives the residual
  identity (`Tele.residual`'s mirror) directly, and the index pin
  decomposes the residual at the ambient environment, v1-verbatim.
* **The `.nested` pin clause quantifies the pin's own open reading**
  (`denoteMeta` at depth `rP`), concluding at the reading substituted
  along the argument prefix — `AnnotTerm.instRevChain`, the exact v1
  spelling one currency over.  The consumer's bridge is then the
  `denoteMeta` mirror of the existing `denote_openRev`/
  `denote_openRev_base` pair (`Verify/Denote/OpenRevDenote.lean`);
  the supplier converts the recorded comparand runs through the
  claims.
* **The fired equality is present** (the seal-22 draft omitted it),
  and the transport clause is `RecRuleLawV`'s final conjunct verbatim
  at the new currency.
* The law **carries the RHS reading** (`∃ Ra`), with the bare-`R`
  grading unconditional (the seal-22 correction; the
  `NatOps`/caps carried-reading pattern — establishment stores,
  preservation transfers forward, consumers identify by determinism).

The statements are FROZEN (task #161, after the consumer validation
pass); they landed in `Interp/IotaLawP.lean` and moved here verbatim
when `RecRules` became an `EnvModelM` field, exactly as the caps
statements did — the field must mention them and `IotaLawP` imported
this file.

/-! ## The tower projection law (task #175 wiring, W5)

A projection-table entry (the direct-structure install's native
entries — task #175 tower-flag: the only ones) is typed by the checker
generically — the stored `ty` peeled along the parameters and the
subject (`inferBody`'s tower branch) — and reduced by the structural
rule `proj_i (ctor p⃗ x⃗) ↦ x_i`; the reading is the uniform
`projAV i` (`denoteMeta`'s tower branch).  The P `.proj` rows therefore
need, per stored tower entry, exactly two semantic facts about the
environment: the **typing law** (the projection of a member of the
family lands in the peeled entry type's reading, graded) and the
**iota law** (the projection of a certified constructor spine is the
selected field's reading).  Both are **environment laws** in the sense
of `caps_ok`/`rec_rules` — fixed by the direct install and by nothing
else — so they are a field of `EnvModelM`, established at the install
(`Model/StructInstallP`, W4c) and transported across every other cons
(`towerOk_cons_fresh`, `Model/RecRulesCons.lean`).

**Why the typing law is stated over a syntactic peel** (`peelPis`)
rather than a `TeleFitPA` fit: the `.proj` infer row holds the
subject's *reduced type* as a graded reading (`WellDenotedV` of the family
application) and the subject's membership in it — never a certified
parameter spine, since the family application is a *type* the run
produced, not an application it checked.  Building a fit from the
grading alone would need the leaf's λ-domains pinned to the type
reading's Π-domains at every row; the law takes the grading and the
membership as its premises instead, and the install discharges the
pinning once.  The residual is then the *syntactic* peel of the
entry-type reading along the readings (`denoteP_piResidual_peel`,
the fit-free mirror of `teleFitPA_residual`), which the row computes
from the checker's own `instPisAt` run.

The iota law takes the constructor application's grading alone (see
its clause). -/

of `projTele (nP + 1) body` — the body under `nP + 1` dummy binders

/-- **The bridge invariant, from the P invariant** (task #161 S7,
Wall C step (e)) — `EnvS.toEnvFacts`'s P-side twin, and the last thing
`EnvModelM.base` was for.  Every field is a projection:

| `EnvFacts` field | source |
|---|---|
| `cval`, `cval_closed`, `wf`, `proj_ok` | `base2`'s own |
| `val_params` | `acval_params`, erased |
| `ty_denotes` | `type_reads` through `denoteMeta_erase` |
| `defn_eq` | `defn_reads` through `denoteMeta_erase` (definitions only: a theorem is opaque to reduction, and the invariant keeps no equation for its value) |
| `rec_rhs_denotes`, `rec_params_le` | `rec_rules`' `RecRuleLaw`, whose first two components are exactly those two facts |
| `nat_op_guard` | `nat_ops`/`div_mod` through `natOpStored_inv` |

Nothing of the collapsed model is consulted, and the P lane's
`checkDeclR_ofEnvRE` runs on this. -/
