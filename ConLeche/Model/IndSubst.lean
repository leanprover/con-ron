# The reading's substitution algebra (task #161, IND TIER part 4)

`TeleOpen.lean`'s absorption laws at `AnnotTerm` (their `Term`
originals were `Verify/Denote/SubstAlgebra.lean`'s, deleted at task
#221), and the `AnnotTerm.instSeq` corollaries the surviving
modeled-iota stages read.

**Why these are not free, and why they are cheap.**  `AnnotTerm.liftN`
and `AnnotTerm.inst` are `Term`'s clause for clause with the numeral
slots carried inert (`Annot/Syntax.lean`), so `erase` is a
homomorphism for both — but an equation between *readings* is strictly
stronger than an equation between their erasures, and the campaign's
own countermodel (`interp2_ne_interp_erase`) is the standing reminder
that no erasure argument transports.  So each law is re-proved by the
same structural induction, and each clause is one `simp only` plus the
inductive hypothesis: the numerals ride along untouched, which is
exactly what makes the transposition mechanical.

What the stages actually consume, and nothing else:

* `instSeq_bvar_full` — a fired spine resolves a frame variable to its
  own slot's value (v1's `padHit` at zero padding);
* `instSeq_absorb_left` — a term lifted past the inner cuts sees only
  the outer `n` values, so the zipper's field branch can compare a
  low-depth reading against the full spine.
