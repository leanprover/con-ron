# `declEtaStep` — the declaration fold's η-closure half, model-free
(task #161 S3, THE SEPARATION; the design census's **C4**)

The P fold (`Interp/FoldP.lean`) used to run the *entire* v1
declaration fold — `declStepS`, with its five install obligations and
an `EnvS` at the prefix environment — and keep only the second
component, `EtaFamiliesClosed env₂`.  The census sized the extraction
of that component at "≈60 lines, six branches, no `V`, no `EnvS`",
reading `declStepS`'s own per-kind proofs.

**That sizing is REFUTED at one kind, and the refutation is recorded
here** (restrictions-are-findings).  Five of the six kinds are exactly
as the census read them — the η-closure follows from `DeclR`'s `find?`
freshness guard and the cons's kind, by `EtaFamiliesClosed.cons_nonind`
(and, at `basisDecl`, by `basisInstallRun_etaClosed`, which is itself
model-free).  The sixth, `indDecl`, is **not**: `declStepS`'s ind
branch takes its η-closure from `hind m hE h` — the `DeclIndS`
obligation — and that obligation's own discharge (`Install/DeclIndS.lean`)
reads `hEC₁`/`hBP₁` off `indMembersS` and `hnonrecUp` off `indRecsS`,
both **model-carrying** installs.  The facts themselves are
relation-level (`EtaFamiliesClosedO.cons` at a fresh member, the
`indMembersR_*`/`indRecsR_*` inversions), but they are proved
*interleaved* with the `EnvS` fold, so extracting them means re-running
two ~800-line inductions η-only.

So `declEtaStep` is stated with the ind kind's η-closure as its one
premise, at the *fixed* environment and valuation the fold is at.
That is the honest decomposition: it removes the P fold's dependence
on `divModPinS`, `reducePinS`, `stdAxiomKeyS` and `declBasisS`
outright, and it names what remains as exactly one obligation whose
model-freeing is S4/S5's measurable bill.

This module is model-free by construction: no `V`, no `SetTheory`, no
`EnvS`.  It sits in the R tree only because `DeclR` does; when
`SetR/Decl.lean` moves to the shared base (S2's finding 2 removed its
blocker), this file moves with it.

/-- **The declaration fold's η-closure half, on the run projection**
(task #161 S4).  The proof never looked at a derivation conjunct — it
reads `ConstantValR`'s freshness guard and the kinds' cons shapes and
nothing else — so it is stated over `DeclRun` (`SetBase/DeclRun.lean`)
and `declEtaStep` below is its `DeclR` instance.  This is what lets the
P fold take its η half from a valuation-free record.

The inductive kind is `DeclRun`'s `Ind` parameter here, so the one
premise is at whatever payload the caller instantiates — today
`DeclIndRun`, after S5's ind unit `DeclIndRun`. -/
