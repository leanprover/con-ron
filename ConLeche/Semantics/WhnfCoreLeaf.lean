# `SetBase/WhnfCoreLeaf` — the six shapes `whnfCore` returns unchanged

Six `rfl` lemmas re-based out of `SetR/Bridge/WhnfCore.lean` at THE
SEPARATION's S2 (task #161).  S1 deferred them here by name: they are
statements about a *kernel function* with no model in sight, and both
lanes' `whnfCore` walks simp with them.

They came down with the two-edit sever's second edit — the graded
lane's `Steps/WhnfP` was reading them through the 2U module
`Steps/Whnf`, whose import the sever removes.

Statements verbatim.  (The design census would rather see them in
`ConLeche/Verify/*`, which is where proofs about kernel functions belong;
that is a rename, not a move, so it was not that batch's business —
the base directory is the boundary that matters.)

**KEPT at the SetR removal's Stage C** (2026-09-05), which deleted the
relation family and the whole derivation bridge above it.  This module
then carried the `ConLeche.SetR` namespace and a `whnfCoreR_*` name
prefix, and it was neither: six `rfl` facts about the *kernel's*
`whnfCore`, with a live consumer in the graded lane
(`Model/Steps/Whnf.lean`).  It is the clearest case in the tree of the
rule the batch ran on — *classify a module by what its statements
mention, not by the namespace it sits in.*  The cleanup pass of
2026-09-06 gave them their honest names: `whnfCore_leaf_*` (the
section title below), in `ConLeche.Semantics`.

/-! ## The leaf clauses

Six shapes `whnfCoreBody` returns unchanged; each unfolding is `rfl`
(the clause is `pure e`, and `pure` at `Except` is `.ok`).  On this lane
each is `Red.refl` — R1, the rule that also covers every stuck fallback,
every `iotaRec = none`, and every uncertified redex. -/
