# The P lane's checker entry point (task #161, S9)

`fueledOps`' twin over the gated knot (`ConLeche/Kernel/CoreGated.lean`).
The declaration checker itself is **not** duplicated: `checkDecl` and
`checkDeclsPure` are written once against the `CheckerOps` record, so the
whole gated driver is this one instantiation — `checkDeclsPure μ
(fueledOpsGated μ F) ds` is the function a gated-lane capstone would be
stated about.

Nothing here is reachable from `Main.lean`'s import closure: the
executable is byte-identical to master (`--verified` is **not**
wired; see the S9 seal in `DESIGN.md` for why).
