# The compiler-trust axiom family (task #95)

`Init`'s compiler-trust scaffolding is installed instead of
taint-skipped:

* `Lean.trustCompiler : True` is trivially realizable — it is
  installed as an *opaque* (stored `thmInfo`, exactly like a checked
  `opaque` declaration) with value `True.intro`, over a pinned `True`
  family.  No new meta-axiom: the model is `True.intro`'s own
  interpretation.
* `Lean.reduceNat` / `Lean.reduceBool` then check as ordinary
  `opaque`s (their exported values are identity functions modulo the
  `have := trustCompiler` wrapper); at install their stored values are
  pinned against the identity function
  (`ConLeche/Kernel/TrustPins.lean`, hand-pinned since task #273 —
  every toolchain's definition after zeta) by definitional equality —
  the task-#47 pattern: drift declines, never silently.
* `Lean.ofReduceNat` / `Lean.ofReduceBool` are pinned axioms over
  those stored opaques (the task-#34 standard-axioms machinery).  With
  the stored reduce operation certified to be the identity (a
  definitional-equality certificate at the axiom's own install,
  `checkOfReduceAx`), `∀ a b, reduceNat a = b → a = b` interprets to
  an inhabited proposition (the hypothesis *is* the conclusion), so
  both axioms are true in the set model with the proof point as value.

`sorryAx` remains the only tolerated (skip-taint) axiom.

Raw pins below, hand-written through the builder in
`ConLeche/Kernel/Basis/Builder.lean`; the annotated forms are computed
from them at elaboration time by `#annotate_pins`
(`ConLeche/Kernel/BasisGen.lean`).

/-! ## Pinned shapes

The `True` family, `Bool`, and the reduce operations' types have no
binders below a codomain (or none at all), so their annotated forms
coincide with the raw pins except for the one codomain annotation on
`… → …`; the reduce-operation and `ofReduce*` types are annotated by
`#annotate_pins` below.

/-! ## The annotated pins

Computed from the raw pins above by the checker's own annotation pass
while this module elaborates (`#annotate_pins`,
`ConLeche/Kernel/BasisGen.lean`), over the pinned prerequisites the
types mention: the `Eq`/`Nat` basis, the pinned `True` family, the
installed `Lean.trustCompiler` and the pinned `Bool`.  The `ofReduce*`
statements speak about the reduce operations, so those are annotated
first and passed in the second command's environment. -/

/-- The environment the reduce-operation pins are annotated over. -/
private def trustPinEnv : List ConstantInfo :=
  [.indInfo boolCvA {}, .axiomInfo trustCompilerA,
   .ctorInfo trueIntroCvA 0 0, .indInfo trueCvA {}, natA, eqA]

/-! ## Environment predicates -/

/-- Is `Lean.trustCompiler` installable here?  The `True` family must
be stored with the pinned shapes (so the synthesized value
`True.intro` resolves and inhabits the pinned type), and the checked
axiom's type must match the pin. -/

  (match env.find? trueName with

   | some (.ctorInfo cvTi 0 0) => ConstantVal.matchesPin cvTi trueIntroCvA
   | _ => false) &&
  ConstantVal.matchesPin cvA trustCompilerA

(`axiomInfo`, the storage kind of every checked `opaque`) of the
pinned type? -/
def reduceStoredOk (env : Env) (c : Name) : Bool :=

  | some (.axiomInfo cvR) => ConstantVal.matchesPin cvR (reduceOpCvA c)
  | _ => false

`Nat` basis resp. a standardly-shaped stored `Bool`. -/

  else
    match env.find? boolName with
    | some (.indInfo cvB _) => ConstantVal.matchesPin cvB boolCvA
    | _ => false

/-- Is this checked axiom a pinned `ofReduce*` over a standardly-shaped
environment?  Requires the pinned `Eq` basis (the type is an equality
implication), the element inductive, and the reduce operation stored
as a pinned opaque — whose install already ran the identity
certificate (`checkReducePin`), the fact the model consumes here. -/
def ofReduceAxOk (env : Env) (cvA : ConstantVal) : Bool :=
  let c := ofReduceOp cvA.name
  decide (env.find? eqName = some eqA) &&
  reduceElemOk env c &&
  reduceStoredOk env c &&
  ConstantVal.matchesPin cvA (ofReducePinA cvA.name)

/-! ## The reduce-operation install pin -/

/-- The pinned defining expression of a reduce operation
(`ConLeche/Kernel/TrustPins.lean`: the plain identity, hand-written
with the basis builder — every toolchain's `have := trustCompiler; b`
after zeta). -/
def reduceDeclPin (c : Name) : Expr :=
  if c = reduceNatName then reduceNatDeclPin else reduceBoolDeclPin

/-- Syntactic guards on the generated pin (checked once at install). -/

type. -/
