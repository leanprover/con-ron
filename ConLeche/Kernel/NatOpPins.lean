# Pinned Nat-operation declarations and certificate proofs (generated)

`#load_natop_pins` below splices, per **committed dump** listed —
`pins/<toolchain>.json`, the repository's top-level `pins/` directory,
see `pins/README.md` — one **pin variant** `natOpPinSet_v<i> :
NatOpPinSet` (`ConLeche/Kernel/NatOpPinSet.lean`): per pin-certified
operation (`Nat.div`, `Nat.mod`, …) that toolchain's pinned defining
expression and certificate proof blobs, as constants
`nat…DeclPin_v<i> : Expr` / `nat…CertProofs_v<i> : List Expr`.  The
variants are listed in `natOpPinSets` in the order below, which is the
order the install gate tries them in when it is handed this list — the
fold's pin-list parameter, task #285, whose default this is
(`checkDivModPinLoop`, `ConLeche/Kernel/Checker.lean`): the first whose guards pass, whose pin
is definitionally equal to the stream's stored value and whose
certificates check enables the operation's fast path.  The
hand-pinned certificate *statements* the proofs are checked against
stay in `ConLeche/Kernel/Checker.lean` and are shared by every variant.

## Why a committed file (task #176, 2026-09-06)

Until then the pins were *computed* while this module elaborated, out
of an olean loaded BY NAME, which Lake never ordered — on a cold tree
`lake build con-leche` failed.  The user's ruling: *"committing the pin
as a file is fine — as soon as we want to support multiple toolchains
we have to do that.  CI can keep the export up to date."*  So this
module is an ordinary one whose only elaboration-time dependency is
`ConLeche/PinGen/Dump.lean` (the interchange format); nothing in the
checker's build depends on the certificate library.

## Why several files (task #273, 2026-09-10)

A pin describes one toolchain's definition.  When lean4 master
rewrote `Decidable` into a structure the v4.33.0 pins stopped
describing its `Nat.mod`, and a con-leche bundled with a Lean release
must accept that release's own exports — so the binary now embeds the
dumps of every supported toolchain and tries them in order.  The
repository's own toolchain (`lean-toolchain`) comes FIRST: on its
streams the first attempt matches and the loop costs nothing extra.
Adding a toolchain = adding its dump here (recipe in `pins/README.md`);
the loader accepts dumps from any Lean version, and `tests/pindump.sh`
is what insists that the current toolchain's dump exists and is fresh.

## Where the trust still comes from

The certificates are **kernel-checked theorems**
(`ConLeche/PinGen/Certs.lean`, the `ConLechePinCerts` library, built by
`lake build`): a dump carries their proof *terms*, and the statements
those terms inhabit are re-checked by this checker at install time
against the hand-pinned `divModCertStmts`.  The committed files are a
cache of a computation, not a new axiom; a corrupted dump fails its
certificate check and the stream declines.
