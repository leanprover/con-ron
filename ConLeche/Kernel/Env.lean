# Declarations and the global environment

Input declarations mirror `Lean.Declaration` (only the kinds the checker
supports so far are present; more are added feature by feature).

The environment is, for now, a simple association list of checked constants.
This is the *verified* reference representation; a faster indexed structure
can replace it later, with a proof that it refines this one.

/-- **The checker's mode setting** — two values since the R core's
retirement (2026-09-05), validated once at startup and threaded as
configuration, never re-read at runtime (the `structsEnabled`
discipline).

* `.verified` (the default, `--verified`): the verified lane.  The
  surface the **graded** set-theoretic
  model proves — `no_proof_of_Empty_cached`
  (`ConLeche/Verify/Cached/MainC.lean`) is its letter over the driver
  this binary runs.  The seven TT-lane checks (tasks #126, #129, #130,
  #135, #136, #137, #146) are off; the β-certificate gate is on — at a
  λ-binder whose **validated** annotation is `.never` the per-redex
  argument certificate is skipped (`betaTest`,
  `ConLeche/Kernel/Core.lean`) — and the io-graded knot slot skips the
  per-argument application certificate under the same licence.  Every
  other certificate family runs unconditionally.
* `.trusted` (`--trusted`): the unverified lane — the same checker
  with the work that exists **for certification only** omitted.
  What must not be dropped is everything believed necessary for
  *soundness* (which is different from "necessary for our soundness
  proof to go through"), so the lane is never optimized on its own:
  it is the real mode with certain steps omitted (DESIGN.md, "MODE
  RENAME").  Since 2026-09-06 it is literally that: the one cached
  driver (`ConLeche/Cached/ParsedC.lean`) at `.trusted`, where
  `verifiedChecks` and `certs` are `false` — so what it omits is
  exactly what those two functions gate in `ConLeche/Cached/CoreC.lean`
  (DESIGN.md, "CORET RETIRED").

**The mode is the cores' only parameter** (task #185, 2026-09-06).
The configuration record that stood between the mode and the
shipped cores from task #172 B2 to task #185 is gone: every field it
carried is a function on `CheckMode` below (`ttChecks`,
`verifiedChecks`, `betaGate`, `ioGate`, `certs`), each a `match` on
the two constructors, so each read reduces by `rfl` at either mode —
the record's `rfl`-eliminability argument, at the enum itself.

**HISTORY, because the spelling moved twice.**  There were three
values until 2026-09-05: `.setModel` at `--set-model=r` (the R lane —
every certificate unconditional), `.setModelP` at `--set-model=p` (the
graded lane) and `.noModel`.  The user's ruling removed the
collapsed-model consistency proof, and the R core went with the proof
it was the subject of, the acceptance delta between the two verified
lanes having measured **zero**; the graded value then took the retired
one's name, `.setModel`.  On 2026-09-06 the *vocabulary* was renamed
to say what the two modes are for rather than which artefact proves
them: `.setModel` → `.verified` (`--set-model`/`--set-model=p` →
`--verified`) and `.noModel` → `.trusted` (`--no-model` →
`--trusted`).  Every retired spelling is a hard error naming its
successor, never a silent alias (DESIGN.md, "MODE RENAME"). -/

/-- Are the seven TT-lane checks enabled?  The one accessor the kernel
branches on — **constantly `false` since task #148 T7b**, when the
declarative verification lane and its `.ttModel` mode were retired
together.  The gated call sites are kept, statically unreachable, so
that the checks themselves survive as reviewed code and the accessor
stays the single place a future lane would turn them back on. -/
def CheckMode.ttChecks : CheckMode → Bool
  | _ => false

/-- Are the *verified* mode's extra checks enabled — the checks the
model lane wants and the trusted lane must not run, because they are
needed for the soundness *proof* rather than for soundness?  The
second accessor the kernel branches on
(task #152: the λ-rule's codomain-sort check, `inferBody`'s `.lam`
clause).  This is deliberately **not** `ttChecks`: the λ codomain sort
is a premise of the set lane's annotation pass (`ConLeche/Model`), so it
must run at `.verified`; and it is a check the reference kernel's
`infer_lambda` does not run, so it must not run at `.trusted`. -/
def CheckMode.verifiedChecks : CheckMode → Bool
  | .trusted => false
  | _ => true

/-- Is the **β-certificate gate** on (task #161)?  The third accessor
the kernel branches on: at a λ-binder whose validated annotation datum
is `.never` the per-redex argument certificate is skipped (`betaTest`,
`ConLeche/Kernel/Core.lean`).

Two disciplines ride on this accessor being a *mode* accessor rather
than a second knot:

* **the establishment/consumption asymmetry fence** — the gate reads a
  *validated* annotation (only meaningful where
  `verifiedChecks = true`) and
  wraps the **test** only, so no certificate a possibly-zero datum
  needs is ever skipped;
* **the dead-branch collapse** — at `betaGate = false` the gated test
  is definitionally the ungated one (`betaTest_of_gate_off`), which is
  what keeps the trusted lane's proofs one rewrite away from their
  pre-gate form.

Since the R core's retirement the gate is on at the *only* verified
mode, so `betaGate` and `verifiedChecks` now agree except at
`.trusted`.
They stay two accessors because they gate different checks and the
kernel reads them at different sites. -/
def CheckMode.betaGate : CheckMode → Bool
  | .verified => true
  | _ => false

/-- Is the **io-grade knot slot** the io body (task #170 / #172 B4)?
Read once per knot level by the cached knot (`coreKnotI`,
`ConLeche/Cached/CoreC.lean`) to select what the internal inference call
sites run: the io body, whose application clause skips the
per-argument certificate at a `.never` binder under the graph-regime
licence (`ConLeche/Model/IOLicense.lean`) — official's `infer_only`.
**`true` at both modes** since the licence ruling of 2026-09-06 (the
trusted mode is defined as the verified one minus certification-only
work, and the io grade is a *licence*, not a certificate; the retired
trusted configuration record had it `true` too).  It is its own
function, and not `betaGate`, so that an attribution probe can flip
one without the other; the
mode-parametric spec knot (`coreKnot`, `ConLeche/Kernel/Core.lean`)
selects its io slot on `betaGate`, the P tier's own bit, so the two
agree exactly at `.verified` — the one instance the simulation tower
is stated at (`memoEI_inferIO_sim`, `ConLeche/Verify/Cached/KnotC.lean`).
Spelled with a wildcard so it is the literal `true` at a *variable*
mode too. -/
def CheckMode.ioGate : CheckMode → Bool
  | _ => true

/-- **The certificate families** (task #76's skip list; the twin's
retirement, 2026-09-06): the work the checker does *only* so the
soundness proof can consume it, and that the reference kernel does not
do — the β-redex argument certificate (`whnfAppI`/`betaPeelI`, through
`betaSkip`), the io-grade application argument certificate
(`inferSpineIOI`, through `ioSkip`), the recursor/constructor telescope
certificates and the canonical-index comparison of ι (`iotaRecI`), the
plain-rule parameter re-comparison, the type-former and per-projection
telescope certificates of structure η and unit-like conversion
(`structEtaCertWithI`, `structUnitCertI`), and the K/η rescue's
synthetic-spine and proof-irrelevance certificates (`majorToCtorI`).
Read through `ConLeche/Cached/CoreC.lean`'s `certAtI`/`certUnlessI` and
the two skip predicates below; `true` runs them, `false` (the trusted
mode) skips them outright.

**Why a second function beside `verifiedChecks`**, when the two agree
at both constructors.  Both are certification-only work; they differ
in what the proof towers need of them.  `verifiedChecks` gates checks
the P tier's *premises* rest on (the λ-codomain sort, the annotation
validations), so the mode-parametric spec (`ConLeche/Kernel/Core.lean`)
reads it at the same sites the cached core does.  The certificate
families have **no switch in the spec** — no proved instance ever
omits them — so the cached core's reads of `certs` are what the
simulation tower (`ConLeche/Verify/Cached/*`) must see through: it is
stated under `hμ : mode.verifiedChecks = true`, and
`certs_of_verifiedChecks` (`ConLeche/Verify/BetaGate.lean`) turns every
read into the literal `true` there.  The `.trusted` instance of the
cached-vs-spec simulation is false, deliberately: the trusted core
skips what the spec runs. -/
def CheckMode.certs : CheckMode → Bool
  | .verified => true
  | .trusted => false

/-- **The β site's read** (`whnfAppI`/`betaPeelI`): skip the per-redex
argument certificate wholesale when the certificate families are off,
else exactly when the β gate is on and the (validated) annotation
datum is `.never`.  At `.verified` it is the datum (`pw.isNever`, the
same predicate as the spec's `betaGateFires .verified pw`); at
`.trusted` the literal `true` — the β certificate is a certificate
family, skipped outright, so the licence is moot there. -/

application certificate at a `.never` binder (the graph-regime
licence, `ConLeche/Model/IOLicense.lean`), or wholesale when the
certificate families are off.  At `.verified` it is `pw.isNever` — the
licence reads the datum and nothing else, as the licence ruling of
2026-09-06 has it — and at `.trusted` it is `true`. -/

/-- How a stored recursor rule may fire (install-computed; parse
placeholder `.inert`).

* `.plain` — a canonical rule (`Expr.recRulePlain`): the constructor's
  parameters are the recursor's leading arguments and its levels link
  to the recursor's by name.
* `.nested lvls pins` — a certified nested-auxiliary rule: the
  constructor's levels and parameters are *fixed instantiations*, read
  at install off the recursor type's major-premise domain — `lvls`
  are levels over the recursor's level parameters, `pins` expressions
  in the recursor's `rulePrefix`-binder telescope context (index
  premises between the prefix and the major are supported: the shape
  certification lowers the stored instantiations out of the
  `majorIdx`-binder context after checking that no index variable
  occurs in them).  At fire time the constructor's levels and
  parameters are checked against these, instantiated at the recursor's
  actual level and leading-argument spine.
* `.inert` — never fires; a *matched* inert rule is a positive
  decline in `iotaRec` (an uncertified nested auxiliary rule).

**Why the fire compares parameters, levels and indices at all** (the
official kernel's `inductive_reduce_rec` and lean4lean fire by
constructor name plus `nfields` and compare nothing — typing justifies
it).  Our soundness argument for a fire is the stored rule law
(`RecRuleLaw`) at the recursor's own parameters, and the P lane has no
typing derivation in hand: the redex is only `WellDenotedV`, and since the
ι-slot licence (2026-09-05) the major slot of a data-motive recursor is
not even inferred, so nothing but these comparisons relates the
constructor's `p⃗'`/`idx'` to the recursor's `p⃗`/`idx`.  Moving them
into a licence was investigated (2026-09-06, `_tmp/iota-uniform/`):
for *indices* it is refuted at the squash regime (`Acc.rec.{1}` on a
cross-index `Acc.intro`: the licensed major's membership in `{pt}`
carries no information, so the uniform fire's law is false); for
*parameters* on the modeled route it needs parameter-independence of
the `_model` constructor values — a set-level fact about model bodies
with no Lean-typed spelling, which the public-interface-only ruling
forbids.  Only the tuple-tower route could fire uniformly (its values
ignore parameters by construction); a route-keyed uniform fire is the
option once that route owns recursive and multi-constructor families.

/-- One iota rule of a recursor: applying the recursor (with its
parameters, motives and minors) to a `ctor`-headed major premise reduces
to `rhs` applied to the parameters, motives, minors and the constructor's
`nfields` fields.  `ctorParams` (the constructor's parameter count) and
`fire` (the canonical/nested/inert firing mode), the two rescue
bits `k`/`eta` and the parameter-comparison bit `paramsBlind` are
*computed at install* from the stored constructor, its inductive's
capabilities, the recursor type and the installing route — input rules

  laws hold at any pair of fitting parameter spines; the modeled route
  and the projection functions do not, because their laws read the

/-- **One structure's projection table** (task #175 S1, 2026-09-06):
everything the checker's `.proj` rules consume about a structure `T`,
stored once at the structure's install as ONE constant (keyed on the
structure: `projTableName structName`; see `Env.findProj?`).

A table is installed by the direct simple-structure install alone.
The `.proj T i` node is first-class — typed by `bodies[i]`, the
field's result-type **body** `F_i[p⃗ ↦ bvars, f_j ↦ .proj T j (bvar
0)]`, scoped at `numParams + 1` (the parameters and the subject are
loose `bvar`s, the subject at `bvar 0`, the earlier fields already
spelled as projections of the subject), instantiated at a use by ONE
`instantiateList` along the subject type's arguments and the subject
(`ProjEntry.typeAt`); reduced by the generic structural rule `proj_i
(ctor p⃗ x⃗) ↦ x_i`, guarded at possibly-Prop instances by the stored
`guards[i]`/`structSort` levels.  The bodies are taken from the
annotated constructor type by substitution alone (`structProjBodies`)
— no annotate, no infer, no pins: a slot with no legal instantiation
simply fails the guard at every use.

**Table-kind flag retired** (task #175 tower-flag, 2026-09-06): the
modeled route installs no table at all — a family without a table IS
a modeled one, and `findProj? = none` already says so at every
`.proj` site.  So *every* stored table carries bodies, types its
nodes and fires its rule, and the projection typing and iota laws
hold uniformly over every entry of every stored table. -/

* `check_inductive_types` peels `nparams` Π binders off every type
  former, reducing to weak head normal form before each, and throws
  *"number of parameters mismatch in inductive datatype declaration"*
  when the telescope runs out first;
* the replay compares every exported constructor record with the one
  the kernel GENERATES, whose `numParams` field is `nparams`, so a
  constructor record declaring a different count is *"Invalid
  constructor"* (`checkPostponedConstructors`).

Both halves are below, and both are ONE-SIDED on purpose: `false`
means official rejects, never merely that this checker cannot see
why.  A former whose declared type is a Π-telescope ending in a sort
and shorter than `nP` is one official cannot peel `nP` binders off
(`Expr.piSortTeleLen?`); a former with any other residual may still
unfold to a longer telescope and is left to the install stages, which
peel it with `whnf` exactly as official does (`whnfTelescope`).

The exported `numIndices` is deliberately NOT checked: nothing ever
compares an inductive record against the generated `InductiveVal`
(only constructors and recursors are postponed and compared), so a
declared index count is not input official reads, and checking it
would reject blocks official accepts. -/

/-! ## The block's recursor suffix, decided on the tags

`checkModeled` (and its cached mirror) asks that a block's recursors
form a SUFFIX of it, and it asks it as an equation between the block
and its own stable partition — `block = nonrecs ++ recs`.  The
statement is the one the fold consumes (`Semantics.DeclIndRun`'s first
conjunct), so it stays; what changes here is the *decision*.  The
derived `DecidableEq (List ConstantInfo)` compares every member's TYPE
structurally, with no pointer shortcut and no memo, so a block whose
constructor carries a DAG-shared tower is compared as a tree —
`tests/e2e/tower_mutual.ndjson` and `tests/e2e/tower_nested.ndjson`
exhaust memory on it.  The equation is decidable on the constructor
TAGS alone, in one pass and without looking at an expression at all,
and a `Decidable` instance is a subsingleton, so substituting this one
leaves every proof about the guard untouched. -/
