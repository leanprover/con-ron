# The gated knot's equations and its one changed clause (task #161, S12)

`Verify/Knot.lean` is the ungated knot's equation set; this module is
the **gated** knot's (`ConLeche/Kernel/CoreGated.lean`, the S9 subject).  It
carries exactly three kinds of fact, and the split is the whole point:

* **the shared four** — `whnf`, `infer`, `defeq` and `annotate` are
  *the same bodies* on both knots (`whnfBody`, `inferBody`,
  `defeqBody`, `annotateBody`), tied one fuel down.  Their unfolding
  equations are `rfl`, exactly as on the ungated side, and every
  inversion stated against a body with an abstract `CoreFns` record
  transfers to the gated knot with no new proof;
* **the collapse** (`whnfCoreBodyGated_eq`) — at every subject that is not
  an application, `whnfCoreBodyGated` *is* `whnfCoreBody`.  This is the S9
  seal's "both arms are `whnfCoreBody`'s verbatim" claim mechanized:
  ten constructors, nine of them `rfl`, so the gated lane owes new
  work at the `.app` clause and nowhere else;
* **the one changed clause** (`whnfCoreGated_app_inv`) — `whnf_app_inv`'s
  twin.  The β disjunct's certificate is replaced by a *disjunction*:
  either the gate fired (`mode.verifiedChecks && mb.pw.isNever`) or the
  certificate ran and passed.  Nothing else in the inversion moves;
  the ι and stuck disjuncts are character-for-character the ungated
  ones, because the gate wraps the **test** only.

**The asymmetry fence, at the statement level.**  The projection
clause is *not* gated (`Kernel/CoreGated.lean`'s docstring), so
`whnf_proj_inv`'s gated twin is `whnf_proj_inv` itself modulo the
knot: no certificate the gate skipped is ever reached for, because at
the zero-kind branch the gate does not fire — see
`Model/Steps/Gate.lean` for the P-tier reading of that condition
(`isNever_iff_forall_pwBit_ne_zero`).

/-! ## The knot equations

`pureFnsGated mode env` is `coreKnotGated mode env`; its `whnf`/`infer`/
`defeq`/`annotate` fields are the shared bodies at the sub-knot, so
all four equations below are `rfl` — the gated lane inherits the
ungated lane's entire body-level inversion apparatus. -/

/-- **THE COLLAPSE.**  At every subject that is not an application the
gated body *is* the ungated body — the same term, not merely the same
verdict.  Nine of `whnfCoreBodyGated`'s ten clauses were copied verbatim
from `whnfCoreBody` (including the ungated **projection** clause: the
establishment/consumption asymmetry fence), and this is that copy,
checked by the kernel rather than asserted in a docstring. -/

/-- **`whnf_app_inv`'s gated twin.**  The shape is the ungated one with
a single edit: the β disjunct's certificate premise becomes

    (mode.verifiedChecks && mb.pw.isNever) = true ∨
      ∃ ta, infer a = .ok ta ∧ defeq ta ty = .ok true

— "either the gate fired, or the certificate ran and passed".  The
head reduction, the ι disjunct and the stuck disjunct are the ungated
statement's, verbatim, because the gate wraps the **test** only and
both of its arms are `whnfCoreBody`'s.

The gated disjunct is what a transposed β clause consumes in place of
the certificate: at a fired gate the λ's datum is `.never`, hence
positive at *every* valuation, hence the zero-kind arm — the one that
consumes a certificate — is unreachable (`gate_pwBit_ne_zero`,
`Model/Steps/Gate.lean`).  No obligation reaches for a certificate the
gate skipped; that is the asymmetry fence, discharged.

(The linter option is `Verify/InferLemmas.lean`'s, for the same
reason: the ten-constructor `all_goals` block applies one `simp only`
list to branches that need different subsets of it.) -/
