# Run the checker over the lean kernel arena tutorial tests and compare
# against tests/arena-expected.txt (lines: "<expectation> <relative-path>").
#
# Exit codes of the checker: 0 accept, 1 reject, 2 decline, 3 error.
# Rules enforced here, beyond matching expectations:
#  * a "good" test must never be rejected (exit 1) or error (exit 3)
#  * a "bad" test must never be accepted (exit 0) — that would be a
#    soundness bug
# The expectations file additionally pins the current accept/decline status
# so that progress and regressions are both visible; update it consciously.
#
# Usage: tests/arena.sh [--no-sweeps] [tests-dir]
#
# An <expectation> is a single exit code.  Until task #148 T0b it could
# also be a pair "<on>|<off>" for the five fixtures whose verdict
# depended on the direct simple-structure master switch
# (`ConLeche.structsEnabled`, ConLeche/Kernel/Inductives/*, task
# #119/#120), and `--direct-off` ran the whole suite against a second
# binary built with the switch off.  The switch now ships `false` — the
# configuration both verified lanes reason about — so the shipped binary
# *is* the former "off" column: the pairs collapsed to single codes and
# the second-binary harness (tests/build-direct-off.sh) went with them.
# The pre-flip codes are recorded in the two expectation files.
#
# THE MODE SWEEP (task #147; one mode fewer since #148 T7b).  The
# checker has one two-valued mode: `--verified` (the default — the
# surface the set model proves) and `--trusted` (the unverified lane:
# checking-mode front door, infer-only internals, no certificate
# families; it absorbs the retired --yolo/CON_LECHE_NO_PROOF_CERTS and
# --infer-only/CON_LECHE_INFER_ONLY).  `--tt-model` selected the seven
# TT-lane checks for the declarative verification lane; that lane was
# deleted at #148 T7b and the flag is a hard error now, so its sweep —
# which had claimed and shown byte-identity with the default on every
# fixture — went with it.  The certified sections run at the default
# (`--verified`); afterwards both suites run again
#
#   * with `--trusted`, against the certified expectations plus the
#     recorded overrides in tests/trusted-expected.txt (the successor
#     of tests/yolo-expected.txt — see that file's header for what may
#     be recorded: partial-stack divergences of the unverified lane,
#     each with the defect it stops or starts detecting differently).
#
# `--no-sweeps` skips the extra pass for a tight edit loop; a landing
# gate runs it.

# THE DAG-TOWER GATE (tasks #215, #226).  The frontend tree-size budget
# is gone; what stands in its place is a fixture, not a limit.
# `tests/e2e/tower_*.ndjson` (scripts/mk_tower_fixtures.py) put a shared
# tower of depth 60 — about 2^60 nodes unshared, ~190 entries as a DAG —
# into one record kind each.  A walk that is not DAG-safe never
# finishes on one, so the fixture hangs (or exhausts memory) and names
# the walker.  Task #226 completed the matrix: the four ACCEPTING kinds
# and the four DECLINING ones, whose verdict has to be reached without
# walking the tower — each through a lockstep comparison bounded by the
# pin it is compared against.  Task #233 added the OPEN tower — one
# built over a field's own variable rather than closed — which is what
# a packed-bound cutoff cannot answer and only a memo can.  Task #240
# added the EQUALITY-memo tower: two structurally equal towers that are
# not the same objects, shaped so that one node's memo entry alternates
# between two partners — which is what a memo keyed on one side of the
# comparison cannot answer and only a pair-keyed one can.  Task #246
# added the three block shapes the earlier kinds never entered: a
# RECURSIVE field (the fvar-occurrence question the install asks of
# every later field), and a MUTUAL and a NESTED block, which is where
# the in-process modeller's own walkers live.  The memory
# cap makes an unbounded walk fail fast instead of swapping the machine.
