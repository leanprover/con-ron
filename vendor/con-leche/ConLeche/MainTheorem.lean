# The main theorem and the main corollary

What the checker accepts has a model; hence a file that declares a
theorem of type `False` is rejected — the form a reader can check
without knowing what an `Env` is.  Those two theorems are all this file
holds.  The corollary's hypothesis is the file: the chunks the binary
read are the UTF-8 of `jsonWithTheoremFalse`'s template, ONE way of
writing a theorem of type `False` into a JSON export.  Its conclusion
is the binary's accept path itself, erroring: the three pure functions
the driver's phases compute, chained — the built-in prelude parses, the
chunks parse, the verified fold accepts the parsed records prepared
with the prelude — return an error.  The steps between are imported:
the parser reads such chunks into records holding a theorem record of
type `False` (`Frontend.parseChunks_jsonWithTheoremFalse`), the
preparation keeps every parsed record (`Frontend.mem_preparePrelude`),
and a stream holding such a record is never accepted
(`no_False_theorem_accepted`: the record is installed under its own
name with its declared type, and in the model of the main theorem that
type is the empty set).  The statements, with a plain-words account of
every name in them, are in `ConLeche/Challenge.lean`; the reading of
terms and the notion of model — and `Denotes_functional`, which says a
term has at most one denotation — in `ConLeche/Denotes.lean`.

* `checkDecls` (`ConLeche/Cached/Installed.lean`) is the declaration
  fold: it installs every parsed declaration — a definition, theorem
  or opaque annotated and pushed with its check recorded, everything
  else checked in full as it is installed — and then checks every
  recorded declaration against the prefix of the environment it was
  installed at.  The binary's driver (`Main.lean`) runs this fold with a
  heartbeat between the steps and returns its environment together
  with the proof that `checkDecls` returns it
  (`Cached.fullyChecked_checkDecls`), so the success line is printed
  from an accept of `checkDecls` and from nothing else.
* `Frontend.builtinPreludeE` is the parsed built-in prelude,
  `Frontend.parseChunks` the streaming parse of the chunks the file
  handle hands out (the driver's read loop, minus the reads), and
  `Frontend.preparePrelude` the preparation of the parsed records for
  the fold.  The three fail in ONE error type — the checker's own
  `CheckError` with the position of the failure (the input's line
  number for the first two, the fold position for the fold) — so the
  chain is a plain `Except` `do` block with no conversion in it, and
  the conclusion is simply that it errors, with no claim about which
  step erred or why.
* `Declaration` is a parsed declaration, and the records travel as an
  `Array` of them — what the parse returns and what the fold folds;
  `Env` is the environment the checker builds; `env.consts` are the
  constants it accepted; `.verified` is the default mode.
* `jsonWithTheoremFalse` (`ConLeche/Accepts.lean`) is one particular
  JSON file declaring a theorem of type `False`, as a whole-file
  template over the chunks' concatenation — not every proof of `False`,
  one shape of one.
* `False` and `Eq` are built in: the checker installs them from its own
  pins, and a stream that declares them differently is rejected.
* `pins` is the list of `Nat.div`/`Nat.mod` pin variants the fold's
  install gate tries (task #304).  Both statements are for EVERY list:
  consistency does not depend on it — under the empty list every
  stream that declares `Nat.div` simply declines, and under any other
  what an accept establishes is the certificates' verdict in the
  accepted environment, which is all the model tier reads.  The
  shipped `con-leche` binary runs the fold at `natOpPinSets`, the
  variants this toolchain committed.
* `SetTheory V` is the set theory the model lives in; the proof works
  for any `V` implementing that interface.

The axioms used are exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice` and
`Quot.sound` (`tests/ConLecheTests/Axioms.lean`).
