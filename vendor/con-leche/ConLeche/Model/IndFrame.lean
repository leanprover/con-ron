# The P-tier frame kit (task #161, IND TIER part 3, step 1)

`Install/IndFrameS.lean`'s machinery at the validated-reading currency
— the environment vocabulary the surviving modeled-iota stages
(`zipperS`/`pointS`/`reductS`/`annotS`) are stated in.

**What this file is, and what it deliberately is not.**  The part-2
correction budgeted a fresh ~350-line transposition of the whole of
`IndFrameS`.  A per-name survey of the four surviving stages says the
kit they actually read is much narrower, and that part 2 had already
landed its core under another name:

* **the chain already exists.**  `consN` (`IndTeleP.lean:262`) is
  `consChain` definitionally — same cons order, same fold — and
  `consN_shift`/`consN_getElem?` are `chainE_ge`/`chainE_lt`'s content
  at bare values.  So `chain` below is a *wrapper*: the chain of a
  spine's **readings**, `consN (ws.map (interp V ρ)) ρ`, and its two
  lookup lemmas are three lines each rather than two inductions;
* **`chainFrom` and its three lemmas do not transpose.**  v1 needs the
  value/base split because `chainE` is defined by a `foldl` over
  *expressions*; going through `consN` there is nothing to split, and
  the survey confirms `chainFrom_cons`/`chainFrom_lt`/`chainFrom_ge`
  have zero occurrences in `IndStagesS.lean` anyway;
* **six more names are dead weight** and are not transposed:
  `padE_zero`, `consChain_nil`, `consChain_cons`,
  `chainE_eq_consChain` (definitional here), `TeleFitV.appN_val` and
  `annotOkV_descend` — the first five have no occurrence anywhere in
  `IndStagesS.lean`, and the last is consumed only by `fireS`, which
  part 2's four-move firing already retired.

What *is* transposed is what the stages consume: the chain and its two
lookups, the `instSeq` pivot between chain-reading and
substituted-reading, and the padding pair — which never appears in a
stage's statement, but is introduced and stripped inside the zipper's
strong induction (`sat_pad_of_mems` up, `padE_shiftE` down).

**The currency delta that matters.**  `Sat` becomes `Sat` and the
context becomes a `List AnnotTerm`, so the padding slot is `AnnotTerm.sort 0`
and its value fact is `empty_mem_univ 0` through `interp_sort` —
`interp` of a sort is `univ` on the nose, so the `.sort 0`/`empty`
trick transposes with no `dummyPropT` detour at all.

/-! ## The tower producers

zipperS's two payoff lines, at the reading.  Both consume the *same*
per-step chain memberships — argument `n`'s reading inhabits the
tower's `n`-th open domain, read at the chain of the arguments
outside it — and they are the only two places in the surviving stages
where a `Sat`/fit is manufactured rather than moved.

The fit's transpose has one shape delta worth naming, and it is
benign: `TeleFitPA` peels by *substitution* (`B.inst a`) where
`TeleFitV` peels by substitution too, so the two inductions coincide
step for step and `PiTeleAV.inst` plays exactly the role `PiTele.inst`
plays in `teleFitV_of_tower`.  What changes is only the residual's
spelling — `AnnotTerm.instSeq` in place of `Term.instSeq`. -/

/-! ## `CtxOk` at the opened frame

`ctxOkR_of_openers`'s transpose, and the one place in this kit where
the premise set genuinely *grows* — the lesson part 2 recorded, met
again.  `CtxOkR`'s per-leaf obligation is a *derivation* (`Infer.bvar`
onto `DefEq.refl`), which carries its own justification; `CtxOk`'s is
a **semantic equation plus a grading**, and while the equation is free
(it is `interp_liftN` against a `shiftE` that computes), the grading
is not: nothing about an opener's index says its annotation reads to a
graded annotation.  So this transpose takes the openers' grading as
`hokA`, where v1 took nothing.

The equation half is worth recording as a small saving: it needs no
`Sat` at all.  Lifting the entry to the leaf's depth shifts the
environment by exactly `k - i`, and the context clause reads the entry
at `fun j => ρ (j + (k - 1 - i) + 1)` — the same function whenever
`i < k`.  So the two sides agree pointwise before any satisfaction
hypothesis is consulted, and `ctxOk_of_openers` never inspects `ρ`. -/
