# The instantiated domains are graded (task #161, IND TIER part 4)

The second half of the part-4 grading bill, and the one that is
**genuinely new content** rather than a transposition.

`defEqAt_of_run` fires a recorded comparison only against *both*
sides' gradings.  Every iota walk compares a statement-frame opener's
annotation against a domain of an `instPisAt` run — the recursor's
prefix domains (`rdoms`), the constructor's field domains (`cdoms`),
the rule's λ-domains (`ldomsL`).  The **a**-side is a slot of the
stored `iota_j` theorem's own tower and is graded by `hokA_padded`.
The **b**-side is a slot of a *different* stored type's tower,
instantiated at the statement frame, and nothing in the checker's run
record types it: `checkIotaThm` compares domains with `checkDefEqList`
and never infers them (`Inductives/Modeled.lean:109-135`), so the P tier's
general grading producer — `InferClaim` from an `inferTypeCore`
run — has nothing to consume.

So the b-side's grading has to come from its **own type's** tower, and
this file is the lemma that walks it: an `instPisAt` run's domains are
graded whenever the type's reading is, the spine's readings are, and
each spine element's value inhabits the domain it is substituted into.
The last premise is the load-bearing one and is where the walks come
back in — which is why the stage that consumes this runs an induction
on the frame position, spending the equality at position `i` to earn
the grading at position `i + 1`.

**Why the spine premise is cheap where it is used.**  On a `.plain`
fire every spine element is a frame *opener*, and an opener reads to a
`.bvar` (`denoteMeta_fvar`), which is graded by definition — so the
`WellDenotedV` premise costs nothing there.  On a `.nested` fire the spine
is the instantiated pins, and `RecRuleLaw` already carries their open
readings **graded** (the ratified iota-seal repair, `Annot/EnvModelM.lean`)
— the conjunct that was added for the pins' own sake turns out to be
exactly what this lemma asks for.

/-- **An `instPisAt` run's domains are graded**, given the type's own
grading, the spine's gradings, and — the load-bearing premise — that
each spine element's value inhabits the domain it goes into.

The induction is the checker's own order: the head domain is the
type's `.pi` domain, and the tail is the run on the β-reduct, whose
reading is the body's reading substituted (`denoteMeta_beta`) and whose
grading is `WellDenotedV_inst0` at the head membership.

**The membership premise is bounded by the index** (task #161, ind
tier part 5).  Part 4 stated it over the *whole* spine, which is what
the prefix branch happens to have; the field branch does not and
cannot — the position induction earns position `i`'s grading from the
equalities at positions `< i`, and a premise over the whole spine
would ask it for the equalities it has not proved yet.  The proof
never needed more: descending past the head spends exactly the head's
membership, so the bound `i₀ < i` is the induction's own. -/

/-! ## Application spines, graded backwards

`wellDenotedV_mkAppN_of_fitA` (`Steps/IotaKit.lean`) builds an
application's grading from a fit; the point stage needs the *inverse*,
because the index walk compares arguments of a spine whose whole
grading it already has (the checker's own `inferTypeCore` verdict on
the statement's left-hand side).  `WellDenoted`/`AnnotValid` are
conjunctive at `.app`, so both directions are one projection. -/
