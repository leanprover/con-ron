# Peeling `Except` binds

The one generic lemma the checker's do-block inversions share.  It
lived in `ConLeche/Verify/ProjPinInv.lean` until that module — the
pinned pair entries' install-time invariant — was retired with the
`PSigma'` pin (task #175 W6, 2026-09-05); relocated verbatim.

/-- Peel one `Except` bind.  Peeling rather than inlining the whole
do-block is what keeps these inversions cheap: `simp only [bind,
Except.bind]` materialises the entire nested block and `split`'s
internal `simp` then exceeds its step budget on the larger checkers. -/
