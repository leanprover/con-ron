# The defensive validation sites, as a named statement (task #161, P3)

The P2 seal recorded a finding: the three *defensive* sort-annotation
sites — `(defeq-forall)`, `(defeq-lam)`, `(eta)` — appear unreachable
through the spec knot, because every path to `defeqStep`'s structural
binder arms and to `etaCert`'s comparison first infers both compared
expressions (`proofIrrel` runs before them, with no monadic
short-circuit), the front door validates every binder an infer walks,
and two annotations valid for level-equivalent codomain sorts are
equal (`PropWhen.eq_iff_holds`: the datum is canonical).

The coordinator's ruling promotes the finding to a **theorem
candidate** with a decide-by-proof mandate: *every expr reaching
defeq's binder arms has front-door-validated metas — prove it or keep
the defense forever; either outcome is fine, but decide by proof, not
assumption.*  `DefensiveSitesQuiet` below is that statement, in the
observable shape the finding was tested in (P2's countermodel
attempts): on inputs whose inference succeeds, `isDefEqCore` never
declines at a defensive site.

Status: **statement only** — no proof and no refutation is claimed
here.  Whichever way it resolves, the checks stay in the kernel: the
checker never trusts (the invariants-over-runtime-gates ruling is
about proof *hypotheses*, not about dropping validation).

/-- The decline messages of the three defensive sites, exactly as
`defeqStep`'s binder arms and `etaCert` throw them (`Kernel/Core.lean`,
task #161 P2).  A drift between these strings and the kernel's would
make `DefensiveSitesQuiet` vacuously easier, and the proof attempt is
what would catch it. -/
