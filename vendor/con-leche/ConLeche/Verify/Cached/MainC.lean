# The capstone letters of the fold `checkDecls`

`checkDecls` (`ConLeche/Cached/Installed.lean`) is the declaration fold
the binary runs — install every record, then check every recorded
declaration — and the subject of the main theorem
(`ConLeche.no_proof_of_False`, `ConLeche/MainTheorem.lean`).  Its letters
are the letters on the fully checked environment the driver assembles
(`ConLeche/Verify/Cached/InstalledC.lean`) read through
`checkDecls_fullyChecked`: an accept of the fold IS a fully checked
environment, and a fully checked environment carries the graded model
(`fullyChecked_sound`), so no constant of type `False` (or `Empty`) is
stored in what the fold accepts.

**At every pin list** (task #285): the fold's pin-list parameter is
free in all three letters below (`checkDecls μ ds pins`), because
nothing the model tier consumes reads which list the matched
`Nat.div`/`Nat.mod` variant came from.  The shipped statements are
these at `pins := natOpPinSets`, the default `checkDecls mode ds`
inserts.

Retired at task #172 with the arena they were fed from: the
`checkDecls` letters (`SPC_*` and `input_SPC_*`), which took a
`WFStore` and a `List DeclP` and converted once before folding.

Retired at the SetR removal (2026-09-05) **with their subjects**: the
collapsed-lane letters `no_proof_of_Empty_SPCD_{R,R2,R2M}`, their
acceptance corollaries and the folds `foldSPC_{R,R2,R2M}`.  Every one
of them was stated over an `EnvS`/`EnvModelU`/`EnvModelUM` carrier, and those
carriers were the `ConLeche/SetR/*` tier — the B4 measurement having
shown a zero acceptance delta between the two verified configurations,
the P letter is the whole story.  This module used to be the only one
allowed to see both lanes; there is one lane.
