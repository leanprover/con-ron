# Fast prop-ness off the head symbol (task #168)

Two pure readers that answer "is this type a proposition?" / "is this
term a proof?" from the **head symbol, the arity and the validated
`pw` annotations** — no inference, no reduction, no memo.

Prop-ness is invariant under application: `zeronessOf (imax u v) =
zeronessOf v`, so the zero-ness of the sort of the type of `c a⃗` is
that of `c`'s *stored* type at every arity, over-application included.
The datum a head-symbol reader needs is therefore **one `PropWhen` per
constant** — the zero-ness of the sort of its type, read off the
stored (annotated, validated) type and instantiated at the use's
levels by `substPW`.

Both readers are three-valued (`some pw` = the datum, `none` = unknown,
fall back to inference).  The kernel's verdict on a datum is exactly the
slow path's `Level.isEquiv u .zero`: `pw == (.ifAllZero [])` ⟺ the
sort is zero at every valuation.

Trust: the readers consume annotations the checker validates
(`(forall-cod)`, `(lam-cod-leaf)`/`(lam-cod-chain)` in `inferBody`;
the stored types were validated at install), so they may only be
*consulted* at the verified modes (`mode.verifiedChecks`) — the trusted core
writes no data and the parser default stays.  The **"definitely not a
proof" arm** (`notProofFast`) needs no model theorem: refusing the
proof-irrelevance shortcut is always sound; its obligation is
kernel-level agreement with the slow path, which the landing census
records (DESIGN.md, task #168).  The **"definitely a proof" arm** is a
squash-regime licence (`ConLeche/Model/Steps/IrrelFast.lean`).

/-- The residual after peeling `k` *syntactic* ∀ binders whose data
are all `.never` (no substitution — the residual may mention the
peeled binders; the readers only look at its head shape).  The
`.never` requirement costs no coverage on validated types — the
binders of a type former `∀ p⃗, Sort u` all carry the datum of a
`succ` codomain sort — and it is what licenses the "yes" arm's
telescope walk without a certificate (`neverChain_of_peel`,
`ConLeche/Model/Steps/IrrelFast.lean`: every slot is in the graph
