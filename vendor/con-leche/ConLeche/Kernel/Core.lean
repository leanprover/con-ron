# The checker core, in open-recursion style

Every core function is written **once**, as a non-recursive *body*
parameterized over a record of the mutually recursive entry points
(`CoreFns`) and polymorphic in the monad.  All recursion is routed
through the record — bodies never call themselves, and the few helpers
that do recurse (`iotaCerts`, `defEqList`, `structEtaProjCerts`) do so
structurally on a list.  Fuel lives only in the *knots* that tie the
record: the pure knot (`ConLeche.Kernel.TypeChecker`) instantiates the
bodies at `CheckM` and is the verification's subject; the cached knot
(`ConLeche.Cached.CoreC`) instantiates them over the cached
representation with the memo caches and is what the checker executes.
(A third, *memoized* knot over plain `Expr` — `Kernel/TypeCheckerC.lean`
— was the executed one until the cached tier replaced it; it and its
call discipline went at task #221.)  A refinement
bridge relates the two (see DESIGN.md).

The reduction loop follows the official kernel (`whnfCore` never
delta-unfolds; `whnf` iterates `whnfCore → reduceNat → unfold one
definition`), and definitional equality starts with the syntactic fast
path and tries proof irrelevance before structural congruence.
Inference re-checks the application argument and the λ-annotation: the
soundness claims re-derive their membership slots from those checks at
their own fuel.  The official kernel's *infer-only* mode is deferred
until the refinement bridge's fuel-determinism machinery lands
(DESIGN.md).

Verification: `ConLeche.Model.*` and `ConLeche.Verify.*` (claims),
`ConLeche.Verify.*` (inversions), both stated against the bodies with
hypotheses about the record and discharged by one induction at the
knot.

/-- **The verdict of a failure, everywhere in the binary** — the one
error type the whole accept path reports (task #295): the kernel's
steps, the fold, and the frontend's parse and prelude alike.  The
three cases are the three verdicts the driver exits with
(`CheckError.exitCode`, `Main.lean`): 2 declined, 1 rejected, 3 an
error of unclear cause or a malformed input.

Where a failure has a POSITION the type is `CheckError × Nat`, and the
`Nat` is read in the step's own unit: the input's LINE number in the
frontend (`ConLeche/Frontend/Export.lean`; 0 where no line is meant,
as in the size guard, which refuses the input before reading it) and
the record's position in the list the fold folds
(`ConLeche.Cached.checkDecls`).  The two are in the same type because
the driver chains the steps, and the main corollary states that chain
(`ConLeche/MainTheorem.lean`). -/

/-- **The verdict at a constant the environment does not know.**

`sorryAx` is the one axiom the checker tolerates as a *declaration*
and installs nothing for (`sorryAxName`,
`ConLeche/Kernel/Basis/Names.lean`): an export declares it whenever
its module mentions `sorry`, so the record is skipped and the stream
goes on — but there is no set model for it, so a *use* is a
positively detected unsupported feature and the run DECLINES, at the
record that uses it.  Every other unresolved name is a malformed
stream: a REJECT, with the message unchanged.

This is the choke point, because the guard that keeps unresolved
constants out of stored terms (`Expr.constsResolve`) runs *after* the
annotation pass, and annotation infers every binder domain's sort —
so a `sorryAx` in a domain reaches inference first.  Its companion
`unresolvedConstsError` (`ConLeche/Kernel/CheckerBase.lean`) decides
the same question at the guard, for the `sorryAx` occurrences
inference never reaches. -/

/-- The record of mutually recursive core entry points.  `whnfCore`
computes a head normal form without delta; `whnf` is the full reduction

annotations (and is the one place typing is checked). -/

  /-- Type inference at the **infer-only grade** (task #170): the
  official kernel's `infer_type_core(e, infer_only = true)`, the entry
  every *internal* inference call site uses — a subject that already
  carries a validated annotation invariant (`WellDenotedV` in the P
  claims) is re-inferred without re-establishing it.  The knot decides
  the grade's meaning per mode: at a gate-off mode (`μ.betaGate =
  false`) this is the full `infer`, verbatim (the flag is ignored,
  task #170's R clause); at the gated mode (`.verified`, the P core)
  it is the io body, whose application clause skips the per-argument
  certificate at a `.never` binder under the graph-regime license
  (`ConLeche/Model/IOLicense.lean`).  The **shipped** trusted core
  selects the io body too (`CheckMode.ioGate` is `true` at both
  modes, the licence ruling of 2026-09-06); this mode-parametric
  spelling is not the thing that ships, so `μ.betaGate` here stays the
  P tier's own bit, and the two agree at `.verified`. -/

inference body propagates its own grade (official: `infer_type_core`
passes `infer_only` down) without a textual twin. -/

/-- Is this (whnf'd) type expression a unit-like inductive type — a
stored inductive whose recursor (under the `<ind>.rec` naming
convention) has no indices and a single zero-field rule?  All of its
inhabitants are then equal (in the model: the proof point; the
environment invariant supplies the fact for the stored constant).

Task #161 de-gating round A+B+C, item C1 (harvest site 35, list entry
P8).  The test used to be a *scan*: two `Env.find?`s on the head's own
name, a `Name.str "rec"` allocation, and a 20-element
`reservedBasisNames.contains` walk — run on **every** proof-irrelevance
attempt (12 453 724 of them on init-full).  It is the same Bool as a
head-name test against the single pin that can pass it:
`unitLike_eq_punit` (`ConLeche/Verify/PinnedShapes.lean`) proves that
under `BasisPinnedTT` — the reserved-name pinning the install path
enforces — **only `PUnit` passes**, every other reserved recursor being
refuted by one of the three conditions.  So the head-name comparison is
put first and the rest is the *same* two lookups specialised to
`punitName`: `false` short-circuits after one `Name` comparison at
every non-`PUnit` head, which is essentially all of them, and the
`.str "rec"` allocation and the reserved-list walk are gone.

This is a computation downgrade, not a removal: at `c = punitName` the
two stored-shape checks still run, so an environment that has not
installed `PUnit` (or has installed it at the wrong shape) still fails
the test.  Only the *other* reserved heads are decided by the pin
rather than by a lookup — which is what `unitLike_eq_punit` licenses.

/-! ## Structural-Nat literal acceleration

The official kernel accelerates the structural `Nat` operations on
literals (GMP-backed there).  Here the fast path is *certified*: an
operation participates only when its defining recurrence equations
hold by definitional equality — checked once, at install: `checkDecl`
positively rejects a nonstandard definition under one of these names,
so *presence in the store is the certificate* (no runtime flag, no
re-checking; a reduction-time re-check would in fact livelock — the
certification's own `pred zero` equation re-enters the fast path).

The certification runs in the environment *before* the operation is
stored, on the equations with the operation's self-references replaced
by its (annotated) definition value (`Expr.substConst0`): running it
after insertion would let the operation's own just-enabled fast path
discharge its all-literal-argument equations (`pred zero ≡ zero`,
`beq zero zero ≡ true`) vacuously — accepting definitions that
disagree with the fast path on those points, which is unsound.  The
install also pins the operation's and its dependencies' types to the
expected `Nat → … → Nat`/`Bool` shapes (`natOpStoredOk`): the model
reads the operations' function-space memberships off these shapes.

The environment model carries the matching semantic clause: a stored
definition under one of these names satisfies its recurrences, from
which meta-level induction over the literal yields the computed
value.  WF-recursive operations (`div`, `mod`, `gcd`) and string
literals are deferred. -/

hit — `natLitSupported` (three `Env.find?`s), a `natOpDeps c` list
build plus a lookup per dependency (up to seven), and two more lookups
for the `Bool` constructors.  That conclusion is *carried by the
install fold invariant*, in both verification tiers and for every one
of the sixteen guarded names: `NatOps`/`NatOpsV` (the seven structural
ops, `natOpNames`) and `DivMod`/`DivModV` (the nine WF-pinned ops,
`natDivModNames`) both read

  `env.find? c = some (.defnInfo cv v hint) → natOpGuard env c = true ∧ …`

and `checkDecl` is what establishes them: it *declines* a stream that
stores one of these names without `natOpGuard env₂ c` (Checker.lean's
`.defnDecl` clause).  The converse is by computation — `c ∈ natOpDeps
c` for all sixteen — so on every environment the checker builds the two

types the node with — at a `Prop`-declared structure the field's guard
level must be a proposition at this instantiation; at every other
family the rule fires unconditionally.

Until W6 the guard was "the structure's sort is provably nonzero at
this instantiation", which is *not* what the official kernel does
(`reduce_proj` reduces every constructor redex) and rejects the
modelled basis's own `PSigma'.fst_mk` (`PSigma'.fst (PSigma'.mk a b) ≡ a`
at symbolic `u v`, where `max u v` is neither provably zero nor
nonzero) once the pinned pair — whose entries were ungated — is
retired.  The model licence: at a squash instance (the structure's
sort is `0` at the valuation) the constructor application reads as
the point, and so does the selected field — for a non-`Prop`-declared
family every field's sort is bounded by the structure's (the O5 bound
`checkStructFieldSorts` checks), so at a zero instantiation every
field is a proposition; for a `Prop`-declared family the guard says
so of the projected field directly (`TowerEntryLaw`'s iota clause,
`ConLeche/Model/Annot/EnvModelM.lean`).  Ungated rules on a data field of a
`Prop`-declared structure stay out: such a node is not even typed

reduct and loop).  Together with the singleton rule list this is the
standing condition of `majorToCtor`'s structure-η rescue.

The level-parameter conjunct is what lets the rescue fabricate the
constructor application at the major type's levels without comparing
the two lists per call: every route that grants η stores the
constructor at the former's level parameters (the fixpoint route's
recogniser pins `c.1.levelParams == lps`, the modeled route grants η
only at `cvC.levelParams = cvT.levelParams`, and the pinned `PUnit`

the reduction then reads `RecRule.k`/`RecRule.eta` and re-derives
nothing, and the environment invariant `RecCtorsStored` records that a

/-- The major premise's preparation before a rule fires, in the

`src/kernel/inductive.cpp`; lean4lean `Inductive/Reduce.lean:66-72`):

* at a K-flagged recursor the K rescue (`to_ctor_when_K`) runs on the
  **raw** major — it reads only the major's *type* and fabricates the
  constructor from it — and only then is the major head-normalized
  (and its literal converted; a no-op on a proof, kept for the
  site-by-site mirror);
* elsewhere the major is head-normalized first, its literal
  converted, and the structure-eta rescue (`to_ctor_when_structure`)
  tried on the reduct.

The two rescues live in one function (`majorToCtor`); the K branch is
reachable exactly at `recRuleK`, the eta branch never is there (an
inductive proposition fails its provably-nonzero guard), so the split
below dispatches each to its official site and neither is attempted
twice.

Why the order matters (2026-09-06, the Mathlib `decide`-over-`Rat`
frontier): with the whnf *first*, an `Eq.rec` whose major is a
theorem application — `Eq.ndrec … (Int.decEq._proof_1 a b h)` with
`h := Nat.eq_of_beq_eq_true …`, the shape `instDecidableEqRat`'s
`h ▸` produces — delta-unfolds the proofs and iota-grinds
`Nat.eq_of_beq_eq_true`'s `Nat.brecOn` tower unarily down the
`604800` literal: one knot level per `succ`, fuel exhaustion.  The
official order fabricates `Eq.refl` from the type (`a ≡ b` by the
`Nat` literal fast paths) and never opens either proof. -/

level-instantiated at the subject type's levels, with the subject

loose variables in ONE traversal (`instantiateList`: `bvar 0` is the

/-- **The structural projection's certificate** (task #175 W6, the
squash-regime licence): the redex `proj_i (C p⃗ x⃗)` fires only after
its constructor spine is certified against `C`'s stored type at the
redex's own levels — `iotaCerts`, each argument's inferred type defeq
to its binder domain, the domains instantiated along the spine.  This
is what makes the rule sound-to-model at a squash instantiation: there
the constructor application is the point and so is every field
(every field of a non-`Prop`-declared family is a proposition where
the family is one, by the O5 bound; at a `Prop`-declared family the
fire guard says so of the projected field), and the certified fit is
what pins the selected argument to its domain — a grading alone pins
nothing at bit `0`.  In the graph regime the fit is redundant with
the application's grading, which the tower law consumes there.

History: until task #161 P9 the certificate ran six things (the two
sort legs and their comparisons, on top of the two `inferTypeCore`
runs); P9 cut it to the two runs (the pinned pair's row walked the
spine's typings out of the subject's own run, concretely at arity
four); W6 replaces the two runs by the one telescope certificate,
which is the same per-argument `inferIO` + `defeq` work the subject's
run performed inside `inferSpine`, and drops the field's separate
`inferIO`.  The official kernel's `reduce_proj` certifies nothing —
this is the F4 conformance residue, which the P lane's `ProjStep`
row consumes through `certs_teleLic`.  The spine is a subterm of the
subject, so the certificate is *licensed* like the ι slot's
(`iotaCerts`' docstring): at the verified P mode a `.never` binder's
certificate is skipped — every field binder of an ordinary `structure`
— which is the io skip the retired two-run certificate had through
`inferSpine`. -/

/-- **The fire certificate as the mode runs it** (parity mirrors
official, 2026-09-06).  The P core (`verified = true`) certifies the
constructor spine (`projCert`, licensed by the mode's β gate) — the
model's licence for the fire at a squash instantiation.  The parity
core is the official kernel's: `reduce_proj` reduces every
constructor redex with no certificate (`type_checker.cpp`), so at
`verified = false` no certificate runs and the rule fires
unconditionally.  The trusted lane stays an accept-superset of the P
lane, which is all the agreement floor
(`Verify/Cached/AgreeFloor.lean`) asks of it. -/

/-- **THE β SITE'S GATE** (task #161): does the mode's β gate fire at
this binder?

At `mode.betaGate` (i.e. at `.verified`, and nowhere else) a λ-binder
whose *validated* annotation datum is `.never` — "the codomain sort is
nonzero at every valuation" — licenses skipping the certificate: the
sealed P claim's positive branch (`WellDenotedV_beta_gate`,
`ConLeche/Model/Steps/Gate.lean`) derives the domain membership from the
redex's own `WellDenoted` slot and consumes no certificate at all.

At a possibly-zero datum, and at every non-gated mode, the certificate
runs unconditionally — the establishment/consumption asymmetry fence,
and task #100's de-gating ruling, both untouched: *that* gate read a
**computed** nonzero sort (unsound-to-model under the domain-relative
collapse); this one reads a **validated annotation**.

Both arms hand back the same reduct, so reducts stay
annotation-blind; the dead-branch collapse is `betaGateFires_off`
(`Verify/BetaGate.lean`).

The gate is a **pure early return**, not a wrapper around the test's
`Bool`, and that shape is load-bearing: the `else` arm is then the
pre-gate clause *byte-for-byte*, so every existing proof of every
non-gated mode continues verbatim after one `simp only` on the
condition.  (A wrapper around the test would have re-associated the
certificate's binds and cost every site a `bind_assoc` as well.)

`betaGateFires` is deliberately mode-and-datum only — it reads no
expression and runs no computation, so it is decidable *before* the
certificate would have started, which is the whole performance
point. -/

with one clause changed — the application rule's per-argument
certificate is skipped when the ∀'s validated annotation licenses it
(`ConLeche/Kernel/CoreIO.lean`'s module docstring holds the design
record).  The gate wraps the *test* only; the computed type
(`body.instantiate1 a`) and the "function expected" rejection are
`inferBody`'s, verbatim, so the lane is annotation-blind in its
results (law 1 (iii)).  Recursion is through `r.infer`: the io knot
ties this body to an io-grade record (`CoreFns.ioView` at the knot's
io slot, or `coreKnotIO`'s leaf lane), which is how the grade
propagates — official's `infer_type_core(e, infer_only)` passing
`infer_only` to every recursive call.

hints (unfold only the side with the greater hint; at equal hints try
the same-head congruence short-circuit, then unfold both).  Each
literal-acceleration and unfolding step is one **iteration of this

/-! ### The untrusted annotation writes (task #161 P5)

The pass is the existing normalizer: at the verified modes its ∀/λ
clauses *write* the `pw` datum the front door then *validates*.  The
write is untrusted by design — a wrong datum declines, never
unsoundness — and it is a no-op wherever the input already carries a
non-placeholder annotation (`pwWritten`): explicit input annotations
are judged by validation, never overwritten.  The parser's placeholder
for an absent `"pw"` field is `.never`, which is also a legitimate
value; the pass therefore recomputes over `.never` unconditionally
(harmless: a genuinely never-zero codomain recomputes to `.never`),
and the *only* input annotations preserved are the `ifAllZero` ones.

/-- The ∀ node's datum: the zero-ness of the *codomain*'s sort, on the
already-annotated opened body — exactly the value `inferBody`'s ∀
clause validates against (`(forall-cod)`).

**The chain read (task #161 P5, proof-lane repair).**  A ∀ body that is
itself a ∀ reuses its inner neighbour's datum instead of inferring:
`zeronessOf (imax u v) = zeronessOf v`, so every node of a telescope
carries the *leaf* codomain sort's zero-ness.  This is the same rule
`annotPwLam` already applies through `lamPw`, and it is what makes the
spec pass pay **one** inference per ∀ telescope, as the design's
telescope-collapse paragraph claims — and what makes it agree with the
interned pass, which computes at the leaf and threads outward
(`annotateBindersOutI`).

Without it the spec inferred the whole inner telescope at every node,
so it *failed* on terms the interned pass accepts — e.g.
`∀ (x : Prop), ∀ (y : Foo), Prop` with `Foo` absent from the
environment: `annotate` never looks a constant up, but inferring the
inner ∀ node does.  See DESIGN.md, task #161 P5 proof-lane finding. -/
