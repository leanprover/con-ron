# The advertised statements

ConLeche is a proof checker for Lean's export format: hand it the stream
of declarations `lean4export` writes for a Lean development and it
re-checks every one of them from scratch.  This module states the
two theorems the project exists to prove and leaves them `sorry`; the
proofs are in `ConLeche/MainTheorem.lean`.  Nothing imports this file.

> **Main theorem.**  If the checker accepts a stream, the environment
> it built has a model in every set theory `V`: one set per constant
> under which every constant — every theorem included — is a member
> of its type, `False` is empty, and `Eq` is set equality.

> whose type is `False`.

The second is a corollary of the first: `False` denotes the empty set,
which has no members.  An accepted stream is therefore not a proof of
a contradiction, and more: every statement it proves is true in the
model.  Definitional equalities need no clause of their own — a reader
who cares that a definition unfolds as declared states that as a
theorem proved by `rfl`, and `Model`'s `eq_equality` field, which says
the built-in `Eq` denotes set equality, turns that theorem into the
equation of the two sides' denotations.

* `checkDecls` is the shipped checking function — the one the
  `con-leche` binary runs on the parsed stream; `.verified` is its
  default `--verified` mode.
* `ds : List DeclC` is the parsed stream, `Env` the environment the
  checker builds, `env.consts` the constants it accepted; `.ok env`
  says the checker accepted `ds` and this is what it accepted.
* `Model V env` (`ConLeche/Denotes.lean`) is a model of `env` in `V`,
  built on `Denotes`, the reading of a checker term as a set; that
  file is the whole of what the main theorem's meaning rests on beyond
  the checker's own data types.  It also proves `Denotes_functional`:
  a term has at most one denotation, so where `Model` says a stored
  constant is a member of *some* denotation of its type, it is saying
  so of *the* denotation.
* `SetTheory V` is not a hypothesis about the input: the proof works
  for every `V` implementing that interface and never fixes one.
* `c.toConstantVal.type = .const falseName []` says `c` is a proof of
  `False`.  `False` is built in: the checker installs it from its own
  pin, and a stream that declares `False` or `False.rec` differently is
  rejected, so the conclusion needs no hypothesis about the input
  beyond its acceptance.

The statements are about the checking function, not the process:
reading and parsing the bytes is outside them, as is the `--trusted`
mode.  See README.md.
