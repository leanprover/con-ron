/-!
Command-line driver: `con-leche FILE.ndjson` reads a **raw** lean4export
NDJSON file and checks the declarations in order.  There is no
preprocessor and no external dependency: every inductive block is
installed by the fixed-point route, or through a `_model` family the
frontend generates in-process at parse time
(`ConLeche/Frontend/InModel/*`) and then checks as ordinary
declarations; no model is ever read from the input.

Exit codes follow the lean kernel arena convention:
* 0 — all declarations accepted
* 1 — a declaration was rejected as invalid.  An out-of-memory
  condition also exits 1: it is the Lean runtime's own panic
  (`lean_internal_panic_out_of_memory` prints "INTERNAL PANIC: out of
  memory" on stderr and calls `exit(1)`), uncatchable in process, so
  the message on stderr is what tells the two apart.
* 2 — the checker declined: it positively detected a feature it does not
  support (yet).  Never used for "something unexpectedly went wrong".
  A diagnostic run that stops before the fold exits 2 for the same
  reason it is not an accept: `CON_LECHE_INMODEL_CENSUS=1` reports the
  in-process modeller's outcomes after the parse and never checks
  anything.
* 3 — bad usage, malformed input, or an internal failure of unclear cause

**NO TEMPORARY FILES.**  The checker writes
nothing outside its own stdout/stderr, and reads its input strictly
forward, one `getLine` at a time (`Frontend.parseExportHandleD`), so a
Mathlib-scale export never materialises anywhere — not on disk, and in
particular not in `/tmp`, which is commonly a RAM-backed tmpfs where a
multi-gigabyte scratch file would be charged to memory.  There is
nothing to clean up on any exit path.  The rule for anything that
*does* need scratch space — the test scripts, which gunzip fixtures —
is: honour `TMPDIR` if set, otherwise `./_tmp/tmp` (the project's
on-disk scratch convention); never default to the system temp
directory.

/-- **Phase A's loop — the driver's install pass, carrying its own
accepting run.**  Each record is installed by
`ConLeche.Cached.annotDeclStep`: a separable value declaration is
annotated and pushed with its check recorded, everything else is checked
in full.  The loop carries the chain of accepting steps
(`ConLeche.Cached.InstallRun`) of the records it has consumed — a
proposition, so nothing at run time — and returns it with the result:
what this loop returns IS an `InstalledEnv mode natOpPinSets ds.toList`
(`ConLeche/Cached/Installed.lean`), phase A of the fold `checkDecls`.
The records are the ARRAY the prepare step produced and the driver
holds to the end anyway (a rejection names its declaration by indexing
it), so the loop walks it BY INDEX — nothing converts a million
records into a list — while the run it carries is over
`ds.toList.take i`, the shape every lemma above it is stated in.
Whatever it prints between steps is irrelevant to that type, which is
why ONE loop serves the plain run and the `--progress` heartbeat
alike.

**Written tail-recursively, threading `p` and `s` LINEARLY**: a
`for … in ds` loop with `let mut` accumulators desugars to code that
`lean_inc`s both the `FEnv` and the `CState` before each step, so
`lean_is_exclusive` is false at the index inserts and every hashmap
copies its bucket array per declaration — quadratic at Mathlib
scale.  Here the previous `p`/`s` are dead at the
recursive call, so the C carries no `lean_inc` of either before the
step, and the cost per declaration is flat.  The run is carried in the
SNOC direction (`InstallRun.snoc`) precisely so that the call stays a
tail call: a cons-direction proof would wrap the result on the way
back, one frame per declaration.  (The index measure makes this a
well-founded recursion; the compiler's recursive function is the same
tail call, and the measure is erased.)

**Stride 1 is the localisation lane.**  With `--progress` (bare, or
`--progress=1`) every declaration is announced before it is installed,
so a run that dies — an OOM, a timeout, a `SIGKILL` — names on its last
line the declaration it died in.  The index is the FOLD position, not
the stream's record index: the parse folds the basis and `quot` blocks
into single records and generates the in-process models, so the two
drift apart by a stream-dependent amount.  Calibrate by NAME. -/

is claimed: this loop is the sequential baseline the pool below is
measured against.  It runs on ONE DEDICATED WORKER THREAD all the
same: the loop's cost is dominated by the per-record memo
state, that state comes out of the running thread's own mimalloc heap,
and the main thread's heap after the install phase is two gigabytes of
live environment with the parse's and the install's freed temporaries
scattered through it — allocating phase B out of that scatter costs a

/-! ### The pool: phase B on `--jobs=<n>` threads

The records' checks are independent by construction — each reads the
installed index at its own prefix view, its own record, and a fresh
memo state — so phase B is handed to `n` long-lived worker tasks
(`IO.asTask` on dedicated threads: exactly `n` threads whatever the
runtime's own pool size).  The work is millions of mostly tiny checks
with a skewed tail (single bodies of an hour exist) and the heavy ones
sit CLOSE TOGETHER in the stream, so a worker claims ONE record per
atomic claim off one shared counter: a cluster of heavy declarations is
spread over the whole pool instead of serialising inside one claimed
range, and the only item that can strand the pool is the single largest
check.  The claim costs one `modifyGet` on an `IO.Ref` per record,
which is below the third decimal of a run.  Each worker keeps
its results in its own array (record index, `RecordResult`), which
is what a record's check IS: the `GroupChecked` fact of that record
or its tagged error (`ConLeche.Cached.checkRecordResult`).  The pool
merges the arrays by index into one table and walks it in record
order (`ConLeche.Cached.collectChecks`): the walk stops at the first
failing record in FOLD order, so the verdict — and the declaration the
rejection names — is the sequential walk's, `checkPendingList`'s,
whatever the workers' timing.  **Determinism on a failure**: a worker
that fails record `f` lowers the shared `limit` to `f`, and no worker
starts a record at or above the limit — every record below `f` was
claimed before `f` was (the counter is monotone) and is finished by
the worker that claimed it, so the table is complete below the first
failure; records above it may be missing, and the walk never reaches
them.  A worker cannot be cancelled mid-check (a check is a pure
computation), so the pool drains.

Each worker thread reserves 1 GiB of address space — see
`jobsCount`; the default count is the hardware thread count.

Nothing in the pool touches the driver's type: what a worker returns
carries its own evidence, and `collectChecks` assembles the
`∀ i, GroupChecked mode e i` the fully checked environment asks for
from the table alone.  The transfer theorem is untouched.

The runtime marks everything reachable from a task's closure — the
installed index and the records — for multi-threaded reference
counting once, on the first spawn (an object already marked is not
walked again); every reference-count operation on those objects is
atomic from then on, which is the pool's instruction overhead over
the sequential loop.  A plain run pays, on top of that, one atomic
claim per record; the heartbeat lane (`--progress`) pays a second
atomic increment per completed record, for an exact completed-count. -/

/-- One claimed record of one worker: below the shared `limit` it is
checked and its result appended; a failure lowers the limit to its
index; on the heartbeat lane the completed-count is bumped.  A record
at or above the limit is skipped — it is above a known failure and the
walk will never ask for it. -/

/-- **The driver**: `installLoop` then the check phase — `checkLoop` on

theorem `ConLeche.model_exists` (`ConLeche/MainTheorem.lean`).  The
loops are the fold's two phases with the heartbeat printed between the
steps; the fully checked environment they assemble
is an accept of the fold (`ConLeche.Cached.fullyChecked_checkDecls`), so
the success line `checkMain` prints is printed from an accept of
`checkDecls` and from nothing else.  A rejection carries the fold
position of the declaration it names.  With `--progress`, one line at

checking mode, validated once by the caller and consumed here as
configuration.

**One core at two modes, one parse.**  The stream is parsed directly
to `Expr` (`Frontend.parseExportStreamD`) and checked by the one
driver — `checkDeclsIO` above — at `.verified` under `--verified` (the
default), at `.trusted` under `--trusted`.  The driver returns the
environment with the proof that the fold `checkDecls` returns it, the
fold the main theorem `ConLeche.model_exists`
(`ConLeche/MainTheorem.lean`) is about; the trusted instance is
unverified by design.

**The main corollary's chain is what the three phases below compute**
(`ConLeche.no_False_declaration`, `ConLeche/MainTheorem.lean`: the
built-in prelude parses, the chunks parse, `checkDecls .verified`
accepts the parsed records prepared with the prelude).  The prelude
step is the same function, `Frontend.builtinPreludeE`.  The parse loop
(`Frontend.parseExportStreamD`) is `Frontend.parseChunks` of the
chunks the handle hands out, with the reads interleaved — every step
is the shared `chunkStep`, and the chunk boundaries are proved
invisible.  `Frontend.prepareD` is `Frontend.preparePrelude` plus the
receipts printed below.  `checkDeclsIO` returns its environment with
the evidence `checkDecls mode natOpPinSets ds = .ok env`.  What the driver adds is
IO — the heartbeat, the parallel check pool, the diagnostics that say
which step failed and with what exit code — and none of it touches
the verdict.  The three steps fail in ONE error type, the checker's
`CheckError` with the failure's position, which is why the
chain is one `do` block up there and why the exit code below is
`CheckError.exitCode` whichever step produced it. -/
