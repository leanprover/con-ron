# scripts/selfcheck.sh — THE SELF-CHECK (task #199).
#
# Export con-leche's own Lean development with `lean4export` and run con-leche on
# the result.  The checker whose consistency the tree proves is asked to
# accept the proof that says so.
#
# WHAT IS EXPORTED.  Not "the whole imported environment": `ConLeche` reaches
# `Lean` (through `ConLeche/Kernel/BasisGen.lean`'s elaborator and
# `ConLeche/Frontend/Export.lean`'s JSON reader), and that environment holds
# ~233k constants, the overwhelming majority of them elaborator internals
# no declaration of ours depends on.  What is exported is **every
# non-internal constant declared by a con-leche module, plus its transitive
# dependency cone** — `scripts/SelfcheckDecls.lean` prints the root list,
# `lean4export` walks the cone.  On master `2d36855d` (task #199) that
# is 15,738 roots and 34,417 exported declarations (17,062 theorems,
# 16,315 definitions, 781 inductive blocks, 252 opaques, 4 quotient
# constants, and exactly the 3 standard axioms `propext`, `Quot.sound`,
# `Classical.choice`), 533 MB / 9.64M NDJSON lines.
#
# THE VERDICT at that tree, both modes: **exit 0, 37,198 declarations
# accepted**, ~3.5 min, 1.5 GB peak RSS, ~1.5 T instructions:u — no
# declines, no rejections, no internal errors.  See DESIGN.md
# "TASK #199 — THE SELF-CHECK".
#
# WHAT IS NOT EXPORTED, and why.
#
#   * `ConLeche.Challenge` — the Palomar challenge statement is a deliberate
#     `sorry` (see `tests/trust-surface.sh`).  It roots its own library,
#     is in no default target, has no `.olean` in a normal build, and
#     nothing imports it, so it cannot enter the cone.
#   * `ConLecheTests` — fixtures, not the development.
#   * `unsafe` declarations.  `lean4export` skips them unless
#     `--export-unsafe` is given, and skips them even when they are
#     reached as dependencies.  This is SAFE here and it was checked:
#     the only `isUnsafe` constants in the cone are `ConLeche.Expr.beqB`,
#     `ConLeche.Expr.beqFast`, `ConLeche.Expr.beqGo` (the `@[implemented_by]`
#     pointer-equality fast path, `ConLeche/Kernel/Expr.lean`) and
#     `ptrAddrUnsafe` itself, and **no safe constant in the cone refers
#     to any of them** — an `@[implemented_by]` attribute is not part of
#     the kernel declaration, so `ConLeche.Expr.beq` exports as the ordinary
#     definition it is.  The stream therefore has no dangling reference.
#     `ConLeche/Kernel/Expr.lean`'s `@[computed_field]` words are likewise
#     invisible to the kernel and so to the export.
#   * `partial def` bodies.  Each `partial def f` is two declarations:
#     the internal `f._unsafe_rec` (`unsafe`, skipped as above) and `f`
#     itself, an `opaque` constant.  The opaques ARE exported — 252 of
#     them — and con-leche installs opaques as non-unfoldable constants
#     (task #95).  There are no `.partial`-safety definitions in the
#     cone at all.
#
# USAGE
#     scripts/selfcheck.sh [--trusted] [OUTDIR]
#
#   OUTDIR defaults to `_tmp/selfcheck`.  Steps are skipped when their
#   output is already there, so a re-run only redoes the check:
#     $OUTDIR/lean4export/   the exporter, built at THIS tree's toolchain
#     $OUTDIR/con-leche-decls.txt the root declaration list
#     $OUTDIR/con-leche-export.ndjson  the export
#     $OUTDIR/check.log      the checker's stderr, timestamped
#
# THE EXPORTER RECIPE.  `lean4export`'s output format tracks the Lean
# version, so it must be built at the *same* toolchain as the tree.  The
# upstream repo carries one `chore: bump toolchain to vX` commit per
# release; this script finds the one whose `lean-toolchain` equals ours
# and builds that.  (`_tmp/lean4export` in a dev checkout is a v4.29.1
# build and is NOT usable here.)
