# Regenerate PERF.md from scratch: the three-column stream battery
# (official / trusted / verified) on RAW lean4export streams.
#
#   scripts/perf-tables.sh              # full battery, writes PERF.md
#   scripts/perf-tables.sh --render     # re-render PERF.md from the last TSV
#   PERF_STREAMS="let-ladder beta-ladder" scripts/perf-tables.sh
#
# METHOD (the established discipline, unchanged from the task-#161
# canonical table and the perf-eng "honest gap" round):
#   * `perf stat -e instructions:u`, ONE run per cell; instructions are
#     the only metric reported (contention-independent).
#   * every run under `ulimit -v 16G`, `nice -n 5`, `timeout`.  (Until
#     task #230 this line also carried the environment variable that
#     kept the driver from re-exec'ing itself under the OOM supervisor;
#     the supervisor is gone, so the checker is always the one process
#     `perf stat` counts.)
#   * RAW INPUT ON BOTH SIDES (task #207).  Both checkers ingest the
#     same raw `lean4export` file, as it comes off the exporter.  Until
#     #207 con-leche needed a preprocessing step the official kernel
#     did not, so the battery ran the tool once per stream off the
#     clock and fed BOTH sides its output, to keep the two on the same
#     bytes; there is no such step any more, so the honest input is the
#     raw stream and the comparison is between the two checkers doing
#     the SAME job — inductive blocks included, which con-leche used to
#     have done for it.  The numbers are therefore NOT comparable, cell
#     for cell, with any PERF.md before this regeneration.
#   * ALL flags are passed EXPLICITLY: no cell relies on a default.
#   * one timed cell at a time; before each cell the script waits until
#     no other measurement process (con-leche / official kernel /
#     perf) is running anywhere on the machine.
#
# Environment overrides: PERF_REPS, PERF_TIMEOUT, PERF_STREAMS,
# PERF_CONFIGS, PERF_CACHE, CON_LECHE_OFFICIAL_KERNEL.

#    i.e. below the run-to-run spread.  The progress loop is the
#    unverified IO twin of `checkDecls`; the user ruled it an
#    acceptable producer for Mathlib-scale runs.
# The Mathlib row also records peak RSS (`time -v`) and wall minutes,
