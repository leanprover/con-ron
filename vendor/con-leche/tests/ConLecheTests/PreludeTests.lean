# The built-in prelude (task #191) and `preparePrelude` (task #293):
what the prelude holds, that the fold accepts it, and what preparing a
stream does to it

`ConLeche/Frontend/Prelude.lean` embeds `pins/<toolchain>.prelude.ndjson`
and parses it at process initialisation; `preparePrelude`
(`ConLeche/Frontend/Prepare.lean`) puts those declarations at the front
of every stream it prepares — **the stream's own record where the
stream has one**, one of these where it has none.  These guards pin the
prelude's content — the five pinned inductive basis blocks, the four
quotient records with the soundness axiom, `And` and `Bool`: twelve
records — and run the verified fold over the prelude alone at both
modes: the prelude is itself an accepted stream, so prepending it can
never be what fails a run.  (The pinned-block RECOGNITION is the fold's
since task #293, and the `prelude_*` e2e fixtures exercise it end to
end, `tests/e2e-expected.txt`.)
