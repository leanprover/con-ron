# tests/trust-surface.sh — THE TRUST-SURFACE GATE (2026-09-06, external
# review §5.6).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.  `tests/layering.sh` fences one direction of trust:
# the implementation may not import the theory.  This gate fences the
# other: **no compiler escape may appear outside the files that are
# knowingly part of the trusted computing base.**
#
# The escapes matter because they are invisible to `#print axioms`.  A
# theorem can stand at exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
# (`tests/Axioms.lean` pins that) and still be about a function whose
# *compiled* behaviour was swapped out underneath it by
# `@[implemented_by]`, or read off a `@[computed_field]` word, or
# decided by `native_decide` (which would show up as `Lean.ofReduceBool`,
# but only if the axiom pin is looked at — which is why the two gates
# are complementary, not redundant).  An escape is therefore a TCB
# entry: it is admissible only where someone has written down why.
#
# WHAT IT SCANS.  Every `*.lean` in `ConLeche/`, `tests/`, `scripts/` and
# the three top-level roots (`Main`, `ConLeche`, `PinDump`; the fourth,
# `ConLechePreprocess`, went with the preprocessor at task #207), with
# block comments, line comments and string literals
# removed first — so the checker's own *data* (the `Name` literals
# `"sorryAx"`, `"ofReduceBool"`, the `"unsafe axiom"` rejection messages
# in `Frontend/ExportC.lean`) is not mistaken for an escape, and neither
# is the prose that documents the escapes.
#
# THE BLANKING IS A LEXER, NOT A REGEX (task #224).  It used to be four
# `re.sub`s, and the string one — `"(?:\\.|[^"\\])*"` — could not cross a
# backslash-NEWLINE, which is Lean's *string gap*
# (`"…\` NEWLINE `  …"`, ~90 of them in this tree).  A gap-carrying
# literal therefore did not match at all, quote parity flipped for the
# rest of the file, and from there on string CONTENT was scanned as
# code — the #213 lane saw its own error message's word `axiom`
# reported as a bare `axiom` declaration — while real code was scanned
# as string, which is the direction that matters: an escape could hide
# there unseen.  `code_only` is now a one-pass state machine
# (`scan_code` / `scan_string` / `scan_block_comment`) covering
#   * line comments `--`, and NESTED block comments `/- … /- … -/ … -/`
#     (so `/-!` module docs and `/--` doc comments too);
#   * string literals with every escape, INCLUDING the gap
#     (`\` NEWLINE, then the continuation line's leading blanks);
#   * INTERPOLATION: a `{…}` segment of a string is Lean source, so it
#     is left as CODE and an escape inside one is reported.  A `{` is
#     read as an interpolation only when a matching `}` closes it ON
#     THE SAME LINE (every interpolation in this tree is single-line,
#     and Lean's own `s!` idiom is); otherwise it is literal content.
#     That bound is what keeps a stray brace in a plain string from
#     desynchronising anything beyond its own line — and the scan is
#     speculative, restoring the blanking if the segment does not close.
#     The form is scanned in EVERY string, not just `s!"…"`/`m!"…"`,
#     because the prefix is not lexically decidable (`throwError "…{e}…"`
#     interpolates too); over-reading a literal `{b}` in a plain string
#     can only ever make the gate report MORE, which is loud and
#     fixable, never less;
#   * raw strings `r"…"`, `r#"…"#`, `r##"…"##` (no escapes inside);
#   * character literals `'x'`, `'\n'`, `'"'`, `'\''` — a `'` that
#     continues an identifier (`foo'`) is not one.
# Anything left unterminated at end of file (string, block comment) is a
# hard error, so a desynchronisation can never again be silent.
#
# The lexer has a FIXTURE and a SELF-TEST that the ordinary run performs:
# `tests/trust-surface/lexer.lean` exercises every form above and names,
# in trailing `EXPECT:` comment markers, exactly the lines the gate must
# report; `--selftest` runs that check alone.
#
# NOT SCANNED: `tests/e2e/src/*.lean` and `tests/trust-surface/*.lean`.
# The former are fixture *inputs* — the Lean sources that get exported
# into the streams the checker must REJECT — so they deliberately
# contain the very constructs this gate hunts
# (`tests/e2e/src/sorry_use.lean` is a `sorry`, by design).  The latter
# is the lexer fixture, which contains the same constructs for the same
# reason.  Neither is part of con-leche's own build.
#
# THE ALLOWLIST, and the justification for every entry (file → the
# tokens tolerated there).  A token in an allowlisted file that is not
# on its own list fails just as loudly as one in a bare file.
#
#   ConLeche/Kernel/Expr.lean          computed_field
#       The packed `@[computed_field] data` (hash / bvar bound / fvar
#       bound / …) and `Level.hashData` — the user's standing ruling,
#       *"Adopt computed_fields.  It's a compiler feature, we trust the
#       compiler"* (2026-09-04); the census that argues it is
#       `ConLeche/Cached/ExprNodes.lean`'s header.  Same escape class
#       `Lean.Expr` itself lives on.  The expression equality is NOT an
#       escape: `Expr.beq` goes through `@[csimp]` + `withPtrEq` /
#       `withPtrAddr` with the memoised descent PROVED equal to
#       `decide (a = b)` (`Expr.beqMemo_eq`), the same way the names
#       and levels below do — so the file tolerates no `unsafe`, no
#       `ptrAddrUnsafe` and no `implemented_by`.
#
#   ConLeche/Kernel/Name.lean          computed_field
#       A cached hash only (`Name.hashData`), exactly as `Lean.Name`'s.
#       `Level.hashData` is the same escape and lives in `Expr.lean`
#       above, which is why `ConLeche/Kernel/Level.lean` needs no entry.
#       Pointer equality is NOT an escape on either: it goes through
#       `@[csimp]` + `withPtrEq` with the redundancy proved
#       (`Name.beqPtr_eq`), per the user's 2026-09-05 ruling *"do not
#       use `implemented_by`"*.
#
#   ConLeche/Challenge.lean            sorry
#       THE PALOMAR CHALLENGE STATEMENT (task #183).  This file is the
#       *challenge* half of the Comparator pair (`comparator.json`): the
#       small readable statements a reader audits — the main theorem
#       `ConLeche.model_exists` and the main corollary
#       `ConLeche.no_False_declaration` — with `sorry` where the
#       proofs go.  The `sorry` is the whole point of the file —
#       Comparator's contract is that
#       the challenge states the theorem and the *solution*
#       (`ConLeche/MainTheorem.lean`) proves it — and it is harmless
#       because the module is a TCB dead end: nothing in the tree
#       imports it, it roots its own `lean_lib` (`ConLecheChallenge`), and
#       that library is not in `defaultTargets`, so `lake build` never
#       builds it and no shipped or proved declaration can reach the
#       `sorryAx` it introduces.  A `sorry` anywhere else still fails
#       this gate.
#
#   ConLeche/Kernel/BasisGen.lean      unsafe, implemented_by
#       ELABORATOR-ONLY.  `#annotate_basis` / `#annotate_pins` run the
#       checker's own annotation pass at elaboration time through
#       `unsafe evalTerm` and splice the resulting literals.  Nothing
#       here is in the binary; the spliced literals are ordinary data
#       the proofs consume.
#
#   Main.lean                          unsafe
#       THE PERSISTENT MARK AT THE PHASE BOUNDARY.  Two term-level
#       `unsafe Runtime.markPersistent` calls in `checkDeclsIO`, taken
#       once at the phase boundary at every worker count, on the
#       installed `FEnv` and the pending-check array.  It is the same escape
#       `Lean.Environment.finalizeImport` uses for the same call, and
#       it is `unsafe` for one reason only: a marked closure is never
#       freed, and this process exits right after.  Nothing else about
#       it can be observed.  The graph is READ-ONLY from the boundary
#       on — every recorded check reads a prefix view of it from a
#       fresh memo state and writes nothing back — the call is the
#       IDENTITY on the value, and its result is DISCARDED, so the
#       `InstalledEnv` the driver goes on to use is the one it already
#       had and no verdict, and no step of the proof that `checkDecls`
#       returns that environment, can turn on whether the mark
#       happened.  `--no-mark-persistent` turns it off, and the output
#       is identical either way.  No `implemented_by` and no
#       `computed_field` is tolerated in this file.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* ALLOWLISTED, and used to be:
# `ConLeche/SetTheory/Derive/*`.  Twenty `@[implemented_by …] … unsafeCast
# ()` stubs gave the noncomputable model operators compiled garbage so
# that they could be *mentioned* in computable definitions.  Nothing
# needed that (the operators were already `noncomputable def`s, and the
# implementation may not even import them — layering.sh), so they were
# deleted on 2026-09-06 rather than allowlisted.  This gate is what
# stops them growing back.
#
# Usage: tests/trust-surface.sh [--list|--selftest]
#   --list      print every scanned occurrence, allowlisted or not — the
#               census, for updating this header.
#   --selftest  run only the lexer self-test against
#               `tests/trust-surface/lexer.lean` (the ordinary run does
#               it first, then the scan).
