# The proof-term dependency gate's instrument (task #161 S10; redefined
at the SetR removal's Stage C, 2026-09-05)

`tests/layering.sh` measures where code **sits**; this file measures
what a theorem **uses**.  S9's payoff check found the difference the
hard way: the layering gate read

    base 260 / R 106 / P 117 / neutral 3 modules; 0 P->R edges

— true, and simultaneously silent about `Red.beta` being live on the
shipped P capstone's proof path, because S7/S8 moved the modules that
*define* `Red`/`Infer`/`DefEq` into the shared base, where a
directory-classifying gate counts them as `base`.  The campaign's rule,
from that finding, is unchanged and is why this file still exists:

> An import gate measures where code *sits*; only the proof term
> measures what a theorem *uses*.  A separation criterion stated over
> imports cannot certify a proof-path property.

## WHAT THE GATE MEASURED, AND WHY IT HAD TO CHANGE

Until 2026-09-05 it measured **P-vs-R disjointness**: eleven named R
targets (`Red`, `Red.beta`, `Infer`, `Infer.app`, `DefEq`,
`DefEq.trans`, `EnvS`, `checkDeclR_ofEnvRE`, `DeclR`, `declIndRR`,
`DeclIndRun`), each checked absent from every capstone's constant
closure.  Every row read `absent`, and that was the separation
campaign's deliverable, mechanized.

The SetR removal deleted the collapsed model (Stage A), the R core
(Stage B) and finally the relation family and the whole derivation
bridge above it (Stage C).  **Every one of the eleven targets is
gone.**  A gate whose targets do not exist measures nothing: it would
report eleven `MISSING-TARGET` rows, or — worse, if the names were
merely dropped — forty-four vacuous `absent`s.  *The separation is not
weaker; there is no second lane to be separated from.*

## WHAT IT MEASURES NOW

A **frozen module-level dependency pin**: for each of the ten
pinned roots (the main theorem, the letters it is a corollary of and
the assembly lemmas under them), the exact set of `ConLeche.*` modules its type and
proof term reach, transitively, at the constant level.  The expectation
is `tests/proofdeps-expected.txt` and the gate is a diff, so any drift
shows up as a named module appearing or disappearing — which is the
property the old gate had (a target entering a closure is rot; a target
leaving is progress that must be recorded) generalised from eleven
names to every module.

It is a **weaker** claim than the old one — a pin is not a theorem, and
"module X is on the path" is not "declaration Y is used".  It is also
the strongest thing left to say once the tree has one lane, and it
catches the class of regression the old gate was built for: a capstone
silently acquiring a dependency on machinery it should not need.  The
first line of defence against *that* is now the ratchet on this file's
expectations, and the second is the axiom audit, which is unchanged.

TWO IMPLEMENTATION NOTES, both learned by getting them wrong (S9 §1):

* a theorem's proof term must be reached by matching `.thmInfo`
  **directly**.  `ConstantInfo.value?` returns `none` for theorems at
  Lean 4.33, which silently makes the walk report *nothing* — a green
  gate that measures the empty set;
* every root is checked to **exist** before it is measured
  (`MISSING-ROOT` rows, which the expectations never contain).  A
  misspelled or renamed name would otherwise measure the empty closure
  forever: the config audit's vacuity-protection discipline, at this
  gate.  The vacuity sentinel is now structural — a root whose closure
  is empty prints no rows at all, and the diff fails on 351 missing
  lines.

Run through `tests/proofdeps.sh`; it runs inside `tests/arena.sh`
beside the layering gate.

* `main_model` — **the statement the project exists to make**
  (`ConLeche/MainTheorem.lean`): what the fold `checkDecls` accepts at
  the shipped `--verified` configuration, named outright, has a model
  in every set theory (`Nonempty (Model V env)`, `ConLeche/Denotes.lean`).
  It is pinned as a root because it is what a reader checks first.
* `main_False` — **the main corollary**, derived from it: that
  environment holds no constant of type `False`.
* `False_cached` / `Empty_cached` — **the fold's letters**: the checker,
  running a validating mode over the direct-parse cached core, never
  accepts a stream in which some stored constant has type `False`
  (resp. `Empty`) (`ConLeche/Verify/Cached/MainC.lean`).
* `sound_cached` — the acceptance corollary: the model an accept of the
  fold carries.
* `fold_checked` / `checked_fold` — the two transfer theorems: the
  driver's fully checked environment is an accept of the fold, and
  every accept is one (`ConLeche/Cached/Installed.lean`).
* `False_checked` / `fullyChecked_sound` — the letter on the driver's
  fully checked environment and the model it carries, the walk along
  the install run (`ConLeche/Verify/Cached/InstalledC.lean`).
* `False_pure` / `Empty_pure` — the pure fueled checker the graded tower is stated
  about. -/
