# Asymptotic scalability harness (tasks #56, #98) — doubling-n growth tests.
#
# For each shape produced by tests/scale/gen.py the checker is run at
# n, 2n, 4n, 8n (standard mode) or up to 32n (deep mode); work is
# measured in retired instructions (perf stat -e instructions:u,
# median of 3 runs).  A per-shape startup baseline (the same shape at
# n=1: basis install and IO) is subtracted before fitting the growth
# exponent between successive doublings (log2 of the adjusted ratio).
# PASS per shape iff the exponent at the LARGEST step is <= the
# per-shape gate (superlinear growth shows most clearly at the largest
# n — spine read 1.26 at n=400 but 1.58 at n=1600 before the fix, so
# regressions that standard mode reads as borderline are confirmed by
# deep mode).
#
# Gates are per shape, set at the measured master exponent plus slack
# (see the SPECS table below and DESIGN.md "Asymptotic scalability
# harness"), NOT a blanket threshold: shapes that measure flat gate
# tightly (<= 1.15), shapes with known superlinear behavior gate at
# measured+slack so they cannot get *worse* silently.
#
# Peak RSS is fitted the same way for the shapes whose retained state
# grows with n (chain/many/dag/thm): max of 3 runs of the process
# tree's ru_maxrss, per-shape n=1 baseline subtracted.  RSS is much
# noisier than instruction counts (allocator granularity, ~60 MB
# binary/runtime floor); on current master the adjusted retention at
# the largest standard sizes is well under 3 MB, i.e. inside allocator
# noise, so per-doubling RSS exponents are meaningless there.  The RSS
# gate therefore has a signal floor: a shape PASSes outright when the
# adjusted peak RSS at the largest n stays under RSS_FLOOR_KB (healthy
# retention); only above the floor — where a real retention blowup
# lands immediately — must the largest-step exponent meet the (still
# generous) per-shape RSS gate.
#
# Modes:
#   tests/scale.sh            standard: 4 points per shape, ~1 min
#                             measured (budget 2-3 min when loaded);
#                             the CI profile / merge gate.
#   tests/scale.sh --ci       alias for standard (documented CI entry
#                             point; identical behavior).
#   tests/scale.sh --deep     deep: up to 6 points per shape (n up to
#   (or SCALE_DEEP=1)         32x base), ~3-4 min measured (budget
#                             ~10 min); for performance work and
#                             nightly runs — quadratics that read
#                             borderline at standard sizes are
#                             unambiguous here, with their own
#                             deep-calibrated gates.
#
# Requirements and skip policy (flaky gates are worse than absent
# ones — there is deliberately NO wall-time fallback):
#   * perf with working counters (perf stat -e instructions:u).  When
#     unavailable (no perf in PATH, or kernel.perf_event_paranoid too
#     restrictive), the harness SKIPS everything: prominent notice,
#     exit 0.
#
# NOT part of `lake test` (needs a built binary, perf, and a process
# per stream) — run manually or as a CI job:
#   tests/scale.sh

# --- shape table -----------------------------------------------------
# label : gen-shape : mode : base-n : deep-maxm : instr-gate :
#   deep-instr-gate : rss-gate
#
# mode      the shape's label only, since task #207: def = a plain
#           definition stream, raw = a stream whose inductive blocks
#           install directly.  Both are one plain run of the checker.
#           The `mod` shapes (ctors-mod, fields-mod) needed the
#           external preprocessor and went with it; `ctors` at the
#           direct sum route is an uncalibrated candidate to replace
#           ctors-mod (a measurement job, not a rename).
# deep-maxm largest n multiplier in deep mode (standard is always 8);
#           bounded per shape so deep stays in budget even on the
#           known-superlinear shapes.
# instr-gate / deep-instr-gate  largest-step instruction exponent
#           gate for standard / deep mode: measured master value +
#           slack (see DESIGN.md for the measured table).  The
#           superlinear shapes read HIGHER exponents at deep sizes
#           (their curves still rise), hence per-mode calibration;
#           the flat shapes gate identically in both modes.
# rss-gate  largest-step peak-RSS exponent gate (only applied above
#           the RSS_FLOOR_KB signal floor), `-` = not measured.
#
# Gate provenance (measured on master 4f63b6c, 2026-08-24; full table
# in DESIGN.md): the flat shapes measured 1.00-1.02 and gate at 1.15.
# Two shapes measured SUPERLINEAR on master (known findings, gated at
# measured+slack so they cannot silently get worse): lparams 1.49/8x
# 1.78/32x, and fields-raw below.  (ctors-mod 2.58/8x 2.76/16x and
# fields-mod 2.08/8x 2.43/16x were the preprocessed shapes, retired
# with the preprocessor at task #207.)
# fields-raw recalibrated after the direct-install instantiation fix
# (DESIGN.md "fields-raw: the near-cubic direct install"): measured
# 1.92/8x 2.22/32x, gated at 2.20/2.50.
#
# fanout and telescope carry a BIGGER base n than the other def
# shapes (1000 and 500 against 100/50) since task #272, GitHub issue
# #9: both are one declaration with an n-binder ∀ telescope, and the
# quadratic there — the codomain sort's zero-ness recomputed at every
# node — was INVISIBLE at their old sizes, where the per-declaration
# linear work still dominates.  Measured on the buggy binary at the
# new bases: fanout 1.06/1.11/1.19, telescope 1.11/1.19/1.32, i.e.
# caught (and only at the largest step — which is what this harness
# gates); after the fix both read 1.00 at every step.  A superlinear
# check of ONE declaration needs that declaration big.
