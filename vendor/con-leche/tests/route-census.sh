# tests/route-census.sh — THE INSTALL-ROUTE CENSUS (task #207, the
# successor of the native-predicate audit of task #193).
#
# WHY THE AUDIT IS GONE.  Until task #207 the checker ran an external
# preprocessor (`lean-inductive-models`, wrapped as
# `con-leche-preprocess`) whose predicate `conlecheNative` mirrored the
# checker's own recognisers conjunct for conjunct, and the audit gated
# the mirror: a block the predicate left native and the recogniser then
# rejected reached the fold with neither a model nor a direct install.
# There is no second predicate any more — the tool, its mirror and the
# drift risk went together — so the *audited property has ceased to
# exist*.  This is a DIFFERENT gate with a different failure meaning:
# it does not compare two implementations, it pins what the ONE
# implementation does.
#
# WHAT IT PINS.  For each raw stream, `CON_LECHE_ROUTE_TRACE=1` prints
# one `con-leche: route <block> <struct|sum|fix|inmodel|modeled|basis>`
# line per inductive block the fold reaches — the recogniser's verdict
# on the same environment the install sees (Main.lean, the progress
# lane).  Every block must read a route the checker owns:
#
#   * fix                  the direct route (ONE ROUTE, task #210: the
#                          structure and sum routes are gone since Part C)
#   * inmodel              a `_model` family generated in-process
#                          (task #200) — the checker's own too
#   * basis                a pinned basis block, matched by the parse
#   * modeled           →  FAIL: the block is on NO route — the
#                          recogniser refused it and the in-process
#                          modeller did not model it, so the install
#                          declines.  (Before task #219 the label also
#                          covered a model arriving from the stream;
#                          such a record is an ordinary declaration now
#                          and has no effect on any block, so a
#                          `modeled` line means a decline and nothing
#                          else.)
#   * "no install route"→  FAIL: the block reached the fold bare (the
#                          decline `ConLeche/Kernel/DeclCheck.lean`
#                          prints).  On a *good* fixture that is a
#                          coverage regression
#
# Streams: the ACCEPTING `good/` arena fixtures of
# tests/arena-expected.txt (the rows recorded `0`; raw exports, fast)
# by default — a fixture the checker declines has, by definition, a
# block on no route, and its verdict is recorded there with its reason
# rather than repeated here.  `--full` adds
# `_tmp/init-exports/init-full.ndjson`; further arguments are more raw
# streams (a Mathlib cone slice cut from the raw export, say).
#
# Usage: tests/route-census.sh [--full] [STREAM.ndjson ...]
